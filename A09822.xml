            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1 The <hi>election of Chriſt</hi> is his predeſtination, whereby God hath deſigned from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie his onely begotten ſonne,<note place="margin">Chriſts E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> to be the head of Angels and men, and mediatour betweene God and men.

That we may ſafely and confidently relie vpon Chriſt, ſeeing he was ordained by Gods eternall counſell for our ſaluation, and therefore that our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation both is and alwaies was in him. This point is very neceſſarie to be knowne For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſuſpition which nouelties carrie with them, what aſſurance could we haue of our faith, if we ſhould beleeue, that after ſome mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of yeares, this remedie came ſuddenly in Gods head to ſuccour men by? But ſome may aske this queſtion, ſeeing Adam fell not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creation, how was Chriſt ordained a redeemer? for the remedie muſt be after the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19839:8"/>euill for which it ſerueth. To this I anſwer, that this hath reference to Gods foreknowledge. For doubtles God before he made man, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that he would not ſtand long in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie: therefore in his great wiſdome and goodnes, he ordained his onely ſonne the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to deliuer from deſtruction mankind that ſhould be loſt. For in this doth the infinite goodnes of God more fully appeare, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting our wretchednes with his grace, and ordaining a reſtoring againe to life before the firſt man had falne into death.</p>
            <p>The Election of Chriſt is meerely of free gift, as Auſtin prooueth, Tom. 7. lib. 1. de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt.

J pray you anſwer me, that he, that man that was taken into the vnitie of perſon with the word which was coeternall to the father, ſhould be the onely begotten ſonne of God, how did he deſerue that? what good qualitie of his of any ſort went before it? what did he, what beleeued he, what asked he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to obtaine this vnſpeakable excellencie? did not that very man, by the words procurement and taking him vp, from the time that he began to be the ſonne of God, begin to be the onely begotten? did not that woman that was filled with grace conceiue that onely begotten ſonne of God? was not the onely ſonne of God borne of the holy Ghoſt and virgin Marie, not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

            <p n="2">2 <hi>Election of thoſe that are vnited vnto Chriſt</hi> is that predeſtination whereby all they are ordained to ſaluation, that the <hi>father had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to vnite vnto Chriſt, as the head.</hi> For there ought to be giuen a head to ſuch as were to be predeſtinate to ſaluation, in whoſe order, perfection, and vertue the predeſtinate were to ſtand.

            <p>The ſchoolemen ſpeake much of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels merits abſurdly, vpon miſconſtruing of S. Auſtin, as alſo out of a curious and ſubtile diſpute of Anſelmus, in his dialogue of the fal of the deuills.</p>
            <p>The Elect are in Chriſt as in their head. Hereupon Chriſt himſelfe for the primacie he hath among the angels as their head, is called <hi>an Angel,</hi> Mal. 3.1. and hence it is that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſubiect to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>If any other obiect, The angels ſinned not, and therefore neede no mediatour; I graunt indeeded they needed no redeemer, but they needed a head, by whoſe holde they might cleaue faſt and firme vnto their God. They did not neede any reſtorer, but they did a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer in good, without whome they had not remained ſure in their innocencie. Bernard in his 22. ſermon vpon the Canticles. <hi>How can you ſay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was the good angels redeemer? he that lifted vp man when he was downe, gaue this gift to the angel that ſtood, that he ſhould not fall. By the ſame meanes drawing him out of captiuitie, by the which he defended this from cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie. And in this regard, he was redemption to both of them alike. Deliuering that man, preſeruing this angel. Therefore it is plaine that the Lord Chriſt was redemption to the holy angels, as he was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19839:9"/>wiſdome, ſanctification.</hi> Thus much ſaith Bernard. And this opinion ſome other doe gather out of Col. 1.20. and 2.10. but the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruant of Chriſt Theod. Beza extracts a truer ſenſe of thoſe places.</p>

            <p>Concerning the cauſe that mooued God to chooſe vs, or for which he made choice of vs, there is hard hold and great controuerſie both a great while ſince in Saint Auſtins time exerciſing &amp; at this day troubling the church.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19839:10"/>For the plaine teaching whereof, it ſhall bee good to ſhew, which is not the cauſe for which God choſe vs, then which is. Nowe of all this diſputation let this be the ground or poſition. The cauſe wherby god was mooued to chooſe vs or for which election was made,<note place="margin">Of falſe cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſes.</note> is not mans will, nor faith forſeene, nor merits of men fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, nor nobilitie of birth, nor any other prerogatiues, nor yet the merit of Chriſt, nor laſtly the ende it ſelfe of election, but onely that good pleaſure of God founded and grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon his free loue.</p>
            <p>This poſition conſiſteth of two parts: 1. the remoouing of the falſe cauſes. 2. the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the true one. There are 6. falſe cauſes remooued away, mans will, ſaith foreſeene, mens merits, dignitie or prerogatiue of ſtocke, Chriſts merite, and the end of election. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon we ſay the decree of election is abſolute, for that the efficient cauſe, for which it was made, was not the condition of mans will, faith foreſeene, foreknowne merits, worthines any way &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the firſt, Election was not made for the free will of man, or becauſe man did will, and that fortheſe reaſons. 1. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth flatlie denie it, Rom. 9.16. <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neither of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but his that hath mercie namely God.</hi> Not becauſe man would and man would not but becauſe by our owne ſtrength we are not able to will. Here he calleth our will, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19839:11"/>thought, deſire, and labouring of our minde, this will doth the Apoſtle plainely exclude from election, aſcribing it wholly to Gods mercie, which taketh vs vnto him, neither wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor deſiring, no nor yet ſo much as once thinking on it of our owne accord.</p>
            <p>They that goe about to prooue out of theſe places that any ſtrength is attributed to our will, but indeede of it ſelfe can doe nothing, without the helpe of Gods mercie, are wide: for the Apoſtle doth not ſhewe what is in vs, but excludeth whatſoeuer doth ſeeme to be in vs. 2. Becauſe mans will is not eternall, &amp; therefore cannot be the cauſe of eternall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The efficient cauſe muſt of force be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in time or at leaſt in nature before his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. But mans will is not firſt ſo much as in nature, much leſſe in time before the decree of election: therefore it is not the efficient cauſe thereof. 3. If we were elected for our will, many inconveniances would growe therevpon. 1. Gods grace ſhould be ſubiected to mens wills, as Proſper ſpeakes, which is as much to ſay, as that the grace of election were vnder mans will, as the effect is inferiour to the cauſe, the excellencie of mans will ſhould exceede the grace of God electing. 2. This were to deriue the beginning of ſaluation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that is ſaued, not from him that doth ſaue, as the ſame Proſper ſaith. 3. It were in mans power if he would to be either elect or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. 4. All aſſurance of ſaluation ſhould be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19839:11"/>cleane taken away, ſeeing mans will is vnſure and vnſtable, and we ſhould bring in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh ſuſpence or doubting of ſaluation. 5. Election ſhould be by hap hazard, as depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the changeable will of man, and ſo we ſhould make god fortunes idol, as Luther doth well note: he ſhould elect if men would, and he ſhould not chooſe if men would not: nay the ſame man ſhould ſometime be elect and ſometime not be elect. So then mans will is not the efficient cauſe of election.</p>

In the firſt ſenſe it is truely ſpoken, that we were elected without any reſpect at al of faith, that is, we were not elected for faiths ſake, or that faith was not the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe, for which election was made, and this we truely maintaine. The contrarie aſſertion is plaine <hi>Pelagianiſme.</hi> In the latter ſenſe we neither ſaie it, neither can it be truely ſaid: for faith is the

            <p>Secondly, the decree of election is tearmed abſolute, not that it doth not any way looke to faith, but it doth not reſpect it as the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe, otherwiſe it doth as an effect. This is it then that we ſay, <hi>That faith foreſeene is not the efficient cauſe for which election is made,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth bytheſe proofes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not ſaide any where in the Scripture that election was made for faith, or is of faith. 2. Mens faith is not from eternall, but the efficient cauſe of eternall election muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. 3. Faith is the gift of God. 4. The grace of election goes before faith, Ioh. 15.16. <hi>You choſe not me, but I you.</hi> 5. Our faith is the effect of election, Act. 13.48. <hi>So many beleeued as were ordained to eternall life.</hi> 6. We obtained mercie not becauſe we were faithfull, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhould become faithfull: as Paul profeſſeth of himſelfe, 1. Cor. 7.25. 7. Faith is not the cauſe of ſecond grace or of calling, by which faith is giuen, nor of the nearer meanes, namely of the word and ſacraments, much leſſe then is it the cauſe of the farther remote or firſt grace, namely of election. 8. If this were graunted, many abſurdities would enſue. 1. Election ſhould not be grace. 2. This were the next way to giue man the firſt part, and God the ſecond. 3. The grace of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſhould depend on man, and not on God. 4. There ſhould haue bin no elect: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none of his owne nature beleeues, but

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> Election among men is of ſuch as ſeeme to haue ſome excellencie aboue other. Such therefore is Gods election, of them as by faith were to be better then vnbeleeuers.</p>

For 1. mans electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, makes choice of nothing but ſuch as ſeems to haue ſome excellencie aboue other: but Gods election becauſe it is free, doth not find but maketh them that are to be elected. Ioh. 15.16. <hi>You choſe not me, but I you.</hi> 1. Ioh. 4.10. <hi>In this is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs.</hi> Therefore wel ſaith S.

Thus it ſhould be, <hi>By what meanes God ſaueth vs in time, by the ſame he decreed from eternall to ſaue vs.</hi> But now the decree of election doth not ſtretch ſo farre: for God in time ſaueth vs by the preaching of the goſpel: did he therefore chooſe vs by the preaching of the goſpel? he ſaueth vs by the miniſters of the word, did he chooſe vs therefore by them?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> If God foreknew who ſhould beleeue, then he choſe by faith foreſeene: but the firſt is true: as appeares by Auguſtine, tract. 42. vpon Iohn, vpon thoſe wordes, Ioh. 8. <hi>He that is of God, heareth the words of God:</hi> where S.

            <p>Neither is faith the inſtrumentall cauſe of Election.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe faith it ſelfe is altogether the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of election. Act. 13.48. <hi>And they beleeued as many as were ordained to life euerlaſting.</hi> Now an effect can neither be efficient nor inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe of its owne cauſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Faith is not from eternall, but the cauſe of eternall election muſt be from eternall: for it is not likely in any reaſon, that the efficient cauſe of a thing that was from all eternitie, ſhould be a thing that beganne to be but in time.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Faith commeth after election in hir due time, as Paul ſpeaketh of himſelfe, 1. Cor. 7.25. <hi>I haue obtained mercie at Gods hand, that I

Sanct. cap. 17. <hi>Let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the calling whereby the elect were made, not that were elected becauſe they did beleeue, but who are choſen to beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 There is not the ſame reaſon of election and iuſtification. For they that are to be ſaued are actually and in deede elected, euen before they beleeue, as Paul, as Dionyſius Areopagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, Damatis, and other that beeing at mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate learned Chriſt.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 So Paul auoucheth, Rom. 9. 11, 12. <hi>When the children were not yet borne, and had done neither good nor ill, that the purpoſe of God, which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to election ſhould remaine firme, not of workes but of him that calleth.</hi> and Moſes, Deut. 9.4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Election is not <hi>of him that runnes,</hi> Rom. 9.16. that is, muſt not be imputed to mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, ſtudie, or labour.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Election is of grace by Pauls recorde, Rom. 11.5, 6. <hi>Therefore now there is a reſeruation made according to free election. If by grace, then not

            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The merits of good workes are not from euerlaſting, and future matters cannot be the efficient of election that was made from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. 2.

            <p n="8">8. If merits ſhould be made the efficient cauſe of election, theſe inconveniences would enſue. 1.

            <p>Now they vphold their opinions with ſome places of the ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Rom. 8.29. <hi>Whom he foreknew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Papiſts proofes.</note> 
               <hi>thoſe he hath predeſtinated to be conformable to the image of his ſonne,</hi> Out of which place they reaſon thus. If God hath predeſtinated thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew ſhould be conformable in the merits of works to the image of his ſonne, then he did predeſtinate them for their merits of works: but he did, as is alleadged. Ergo</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The aſſumti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>o is falſe. 2. to prooue that they wreſt that teſtimonie to a wrong ſ<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eſe. For Paul doth not teach that they are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate of God, whome he knewe would be conformable in merits of workes to the image of the ſonne of god, but that God did prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate thoſe whome he foreknew, that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to hold for his ſonnes, to this that they ſhould be conformable to the image of his fonne: but wherein? in bearing the croſſe, wherevnto they were apointed. Therefore the conformitie to the image of the ſonne of God, is the ende of Predeſtination, no efficient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cauſe. Bellarmine doth thus &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound this ſaying of Paul, <hi>whome he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knewe by his knowledge of approbation, whome he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whom he would, thoſe alſo be predestinated to be conformable, that is, that they ſhould be conformable
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19839:19"/>to the image of his ſonne: for to knowe and foreknowe in the ſcripture is often taken for his knowledge of approbation.</hi> As Rom. 11. <hi>God hath not ſhaken of his people whome he foreknew,</hi> 2. Tim. 2. <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> Math. 5. <hi>I knowe you not.</hi> Pſal. 1. <hi>The Lord knowes the way of the iuſt.</hi> Ioh. 10. <hi>I am a good ſhephard and I knowe my ſheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here they make an exception: Paul doth not ſay he predeſtinated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhould be like, but he predeſtinated them beeing like. (to be, or that they ſhould be, are not in.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I graunt indeed, the wordes <hi>(that they ſhould be)</hi> are not expreſſed, but they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be vnderſtood, for the verb ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue is vſually left out in Paul. 2. much leſſe doth the Apoſtle put in thoſe wordes which they doe, namely, <hi>that they are predeſtinated that ſhould be made like the image of the ſonne of God.</hi> 3. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles wordes depraued, in placing the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the image of the ſonne of God among merits, which the Apoſtle placeth in bearing the croſſe, as is cleere by the place where the Apoſtle ſheweth from the very order of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all the afflictions of the faithfull are nothing els but the way wherby they are made like to Chriſt. Therefore we ſhould not grieue at it, nor thinke much to be afflicted, vnleſſe we will thinke much at the Lordes election, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are predeſtinate to life: or take it ill to ſhewe forth the image of the ſonne of God in vs, which is the preparatiue to heauenly glorie. The ſumme of all is this, that his free adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19839:19"/>wherein our ſaluation doth conſiſt, cannot be ſeuered from this other decree, by which he ordained vs to the croſſe, becauſe none can inherit heauen, that is not firſt made like the onely begotten of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 2. Tim. 2.20. <hi>In a great houſe there are not onely veſſels of gold and ſiluer, but alſo of woode and ſtone, ſome to honour, other to diſhonour. Therefore if any purge himſelfe from theſe things, he ſhall be a veſſel of honour, ſanctified and fit for gods vſes, and fitte for euerie good worke.</hi> From hence they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute thus, If any man ſhall purge himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe, he ſhall be a veſſell to honour &amp;c. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore predeſtination is for good works ſake, the firſt is true by the Apoſtles owne wordes, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In the propoſition there is a fallacie of the falſe cauſe, for the purging of ones ſelfe from the droſſe of falſe doctrine, ſuch as was that of Hymeneus and Phileſtus, and other corruptions of the wicked, is falſely alleadged to be the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe of election. Paul in this preſent place onely ſhewes, howe we may knowe who be veſſels of honour, that is, <hi>elect,</hi> namely by true doctrine and pure life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſts rule, <hi>by their fruits you ſhall know them.</hi> For this purging conſiſts of 2. thinges, a ſeparation from heretikes, erring from the truth &amp; ſubverting ſome mens faith, the words of which heretikes eates like a canker, and 2. amendement from the naturall ſtaine. In a word, Paul heere doth not teach what is the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19839:20"/>efficient cauſe of election, but onely what is the ſigne and token thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> They vrge Pauls wordes <hi>he ſhall be a veſſell to honour.

            <p n="3">3. Apoc. 3.11. <hi>hold that thou haſt that none may take awaie thy crowne.</hi> From hence they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus. If the crown may be loſt by ill works, God hath predeſtinated none to a crowne, but by foreſight of good workes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The defendants of preſcience of works are ouerſhot in the ſignification of the word <hi>(crowne)</hi> For Chriſt in the named place ſpeakes of the crowne of the Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie, not of the crowne of eternall glory. For he exhorts the biſhop of the Church of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia to be conſtant in his miniſterie, leſt if he faint and faile in his dutie, another be put into his roome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The aſſumption is true but onely of the crowne of the Eccleſiaſticall office, and not of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly glory: many may looſe the crown of their biſhopricke, without any chaunge of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19839:20"/>Gods election to eternall life: but the crowne of glorie none can looſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is no connection in the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it doth not follow: for what? if ill workes are the cauſe that the crowne of ones biſhopricke may be loſt, ſhall good workes be the cauſe of election to the crowne of glorie? ſo this obiection failes in argument. Bellarmin doth not anſwere here currantly. For he ſaies out of Thomas Aquinas 1. <hi>p. quaeſt.</hi> 23. <hi>art.</hi> 6. <hi>ad</hi> 1. That the crowne of glorie may be due in 2. reſpects, of predeſtination, and of merit; and though in the firſt regard it cannot ſimplie be loſt, yet in the latter it may. But the crowne of glorie is due to none, but is beſtowed by gods free gift to whome ſoeuer it is giuen, and <hi>ergo</hi> due debt by notitle.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mat. 25.15. <hi>The Lord dealeth his tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one according to their own vertue,</hi> and this they doe alſo auerre.

The propoſition doth not follow:<note place="margin">Falſe cauſes of Election.</note> for what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is this, If God doth diſtribute his tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to euerie man according to his power, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he chooſeth vnto life for foreſeen merits. For deuiding his talents and election to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is not all one, but it is a beſtowing of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19839:21"/>gifts, which God giues to euerie man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their calling for the enlarging of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his kingdome, ſuch as the reprobates haue alſo. For that ſeruant that had but one talent is the patterne of a reprobate, <hi>for he ſhal be caſt into vtter darkneſſe,</hi> that is, he ſhall be ſhut out of the kingdome of God, which is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of light. 3. Whereas it is further ſaid <hi>according to his owne power,</hi> therein is not noted the efficient cauſe of the beſtowing the gifts, but the meaſure, as if he had meant thus, <hi>he gaue to euery one a greater or ſmaller meaſure of gifts, according as he had beſtowed ability vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one.</hi> That is, knowledge, wiſdome, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie in following his calling. For God as he inabled euerie man with power and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to deale, ſo he inioyneth him a bigger or leſſe worke: to one he gaue 5. talents, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 2. the other one, that is, he beſtowed more gifts vpon ſome, and fewer on other, thereafter as he inabled him with gifts to vſe them well and lay them out to beſt advantage. Therefore that power alſo is not the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which euerie man hath of nature, but grace giuen to euerie one of God, to vſe the talent well that is committed vnto him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This place cuts the throat of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries opinion. For if God doth not diſtribute his gifts for deſerts, as is cleere by that which is alreadie ſaid, then much leſſe doth he chooſe vs to eternall ſaluation for our deſerts.</p>
            <p>Math. 28.8. <hi>Call the labourers and giue their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19839:21"/>hire.</hi> Whence they argue thus, if eternall life be a reward, then they that are elected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto are elected for their merits: the reaſon is, by courſe reward is giuen for merits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There is an homonymie in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the word <hi>(reward.)</hi> Properly a reward is the due requitall of deſert.<note place="margin">Reward.</note> But eternall life in this ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe is not called a reward, but a buſiuely, beeing in truth a meere gift, as Paul declareth Rom. 6.23: <hi>and it is not the wages</hi> of ſeruants but the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſonnes, for <hi>the ſonne of the bond maide ſhall not be heire, but the ſonne of the free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Gal. 4.30.

            <p n="2">2. This place quite &amp; cleane ouerthrowes merits.

If God doth not reſpect the perſon, then he chooſeth for good workes: becauſe he is no reſpecter of perſons, but giues to euery man according to his deſert, reward or puniſhment. And this is againe confirmed by Paul, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. 2.11. <hi>There is no reſpect of perſons with God. ergo:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The connex holds not. 2. It proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth nothing. For 1. the words <hi>[accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons]</hi> is doubtfull: for it is taken in one ſenſe when we talke of men, and an other when we ſpeake of God. For ſome iudge may be ſaide not to regard mens perſons, that in hearing of a caſe ſhewes no more fauour to the rich and his kinſman, then to the poore and a ſtranger, and ſuch as will giue ſentence according vnto law, giuing euery man as he deſerues, and as the law requires, good or ill. But God is here called of Peter no regarder of mens perſons in another ſenſe, not for giuing reward to one that deſerues it: for no man doth deſerue any reward at Gods hand at all, neither is he tied to any law, as men are; but becauſe in louing and accepting of men he hath no reſpect of nation: and the meaning is, that incircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19839:23"/>doth not a whit hinder God from rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and approouing righteouſnes in a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. Rom. 2.11. in the other place God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>[no accepter of perſons,]</hi> becauſe he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all vnrepentant ſinners, whither Iewes or Gentiles, making no difference betweene na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nation. 2. There is a fallacie of that that is not the cauſe, as if it were. For it doth not follow, becauſe he is no regarder of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, therefore that election is for good works; but rather election is free, becauſe God did not foreſee any good workes in man, becauſe there ſhould neuer be any. 3. They take a great deale of needleſſe paines to prooue the aſſumption, which no man doth denie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But they vrge farther out of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid place; that the words that follow in Peter doe prooue that election was for good works. <hi>But in euery nation he is accepted of him that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him and worketh righteouſnes.</hi> Whence they make this collection: Therefore the ſtudie of godlineſſe and vprightneſſe is the cauſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The propoſition doth not follow, by reaſon of the doubtfulnes of one word: <hi>mans acception</hi> in Gods ſight is double: 1. when he adopteth vs by his meere mercie called of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, there being nothing in our nature that he can approoue. 2. When, after he hath rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated vs, he inricheth vs with his gifts, and proſecuteth with his fauour that image of his ſonne which he recognizeth to be in vs. In the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19839:24"/>firſt part of the propoſition and ſaying of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this ſecond acception of the word is: but here the queſtion betweene vs is of the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Therfore it ſtands vnappeachable, that good works foreſeene are not the efficient cauſe of election.<note place="margin">4 falſe cauſe of election.</note> And ſo hauing remooued the third falſe cauſe, I come to the fourth.</p>
            <p>Neither worthines of birth, or of any other prerogatiue is the moouing cauſe why God chooſeth vs,<note place="margin">Birth. &amp;c.</note> as ſhall appeare by theſe reaſons following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> If the ſcripture doth not teach in any place, that our worthines is the efficient cauſe of election, nor can be drawne by any good conſequence out of the ſame, then it is not: but the firſt is true: therefore the ſecond.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> If there be no naturall worthines in man, then that is not the cauſe: but there is not: for <hi>all haue ſinned and are depriued of the glorie of God,</hi> ſaith Paul, Rom. 2.23. the ſame he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth of himſelfe and other Iewes, Eph. 2.3. <hi>we were by nature the children of wrath, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Arg.</hi> If God hath made vs meete to be partakers of the lot of Saints in light, then our owne worthines is not the cauſe of election: but that is plaine out of the Apoſtle, Coloſſ. 1.12. <hi>ergo</hi> this. If we will make our owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines the cauſe of election, we muſt needes make it naturall: but naturall it is not, for it is the gift of God. For God did not finde any worthie whom he might chooſe, but by choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing made them worthie, whome he might ranſome out of the power of darknes, and <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate them into the kingdome of his beloued ſonne: ergo</hi> no meritorious cauſe of election.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Arg.</hi> If none euer was or is choſen of God to the miniſterie in the Church for his worthineſſe, ſurely much leſſe to eternall life: the antecedent is infallibly true, the Apoſtle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19839:25"/>confeſſing it of himſelfe, 1. Corinth. 15.9. <hi>For. J am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, and am not worthie to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God, but by the grace of God I am that I am.</hi> Now I may conclude from the leſſe to the greater: therefore much leſſe is any man, for any dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie whatſoeuer elected of God to eternall life.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Arg.</hi> If God of ſet purpoſe had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, no not of the birthright, in the right whereof one excelled another, then for the dignitie of elderſhip he choſe none: but the firſt is true. For he was not delighted with Cain, but accepted Abels ſacrifice, refuſed Iſmael, caſt his minde on Iſaac: reiected Eſau, accepted Iaacob: and in a word, gaue to the younger that which he denied the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore the latter is true.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Arg.</hi> If any be choſen for worthineſſe of ſtocke or any other matter, he had cauſe to vaunt of the fleſh before God: but that can no man doe: therefore I conclude, that worthines of birth, nor of any other prerogatiue befide, is the efficient cauſe of election.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But one place of Scripture ſeemes to make againſt it, and that is Apoc. 3.4. <hi>Yet thou haſt ſome heads at Sardis which haue not defiled their garments, therefore they ſhall goe with me all in white, for they are worthie.</hi> Whence they argue thus: If ſome ſhall walke all in white with Chriſt, becauſe they are worthie, then they are choſen for their worthineſſe: but the firſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19839:25"/>is true: <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a fallacie in the double ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word <hi>[worthie,]</hi> for they are tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med worthie in that place, that are made fit by Chriſts grace, beeing iuſtified by Chriſt, which they haue effectual proofe of. For he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that doth righteouſnes; but ſo as the tree beareth fruit. But in the propoſition they are named <hi>[worthie]</hi> that haue natiue worthineſſe, ſuch as wherby god was induced to chooſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Neither doth the propoſition follow. For the antecedent ſpeakes of worthines or fitnes to participate the white robe, that is to ſay, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from all ſpot, and glittering glorie, or full glorification and regeneration. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, of the cauſe of electing. Now glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or regeneration is one thing, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to eternall life an other. The dignitie or cauſe of getting the white garment, that is, the accompliſhment of ſanctification, is iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for <hi>whome God hath iuſtified, thoſe he hath glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 They conclude more then was in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes. For the antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is indefinite, <hi>[becauſe they are worthie,]</hi> without defining whether they are worthie from him, or of their owne nature. Now the elect are worthie, not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for ſo they are the children of wrath: but by grace: <hi>ergo</hi> that worthines is an effect of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and not the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Neither is the <hi>merit of Chriſt</hi> the efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">5. falſe cauſe of election.</note> And leaſt any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould miſconſter
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19839:26"/>my meaning, they muſt know, that we ſpeake not here of the meritorious cauſe of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> which from my ſoule I confeſſe to be the merit of Chriſt, and that onely, but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, of the cauſe of eternall election, which eternall election is not ſaluation it ſelfe, but the precedent cauſe of the ſame. Hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen this caneat in the beginning, we ſaie that Chriſts merit is not the efficient cauſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall election, which I prooue thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The cauſe of eternall election muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, this is not. <hi>Ergo</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If Chriſt himſelfe as he was mediatour, was elected from eternitie, then his merit is not the cauſe of election: but that is true, 1. Pet. 1.19.20. <hi>which was ordained &amp;c. Ergo</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the effect thereof and <hi>ergo</hi> not the cauſe. For God did not therefore chooſe vs, becauſe Chriſt was to die for vs, but therefore Chriſt died for vs becauſe God had choſe vs in him.</p>
            <p>Nowe againſt this doctrine, the adverſaries make theſe obiections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. We are elected in Chriſt, therfore for his merit. The proofe of that is, Epheſians 1.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The connex is faultie by miſinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the place, for there <hi>(in Chriſt)</hi> is not the ſame that for Chriſts merit, but he hath choſen vs in Chriſt, as members in the head. Then here Paul doth not ſhewe the cauſe for which we are elected, but the meane or ſubiect
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19839:26"/>in whom. Chriſt indeed is the meane in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e we are elected, in whome we are ioyned and vnited with God that choſe vs: he is the head in whome the election of the members is ſure and ſo the order of election is laid out, 1. the head is choſe, 2. the members in the head. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heauenly Father found no worth in all the ſeede of Adam, he caſt his eies vpon Chriſt, to chooſe members as it were out of his bodie, whome he would take vp into the participation of life. Therefore we are elect in Chriſt, becauſe we were no way capable of ſuch excellencie in our ſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. As we are iuſtified in time, ſo were we elected before the world was made. But we are iuſtified in time by the merite of Chriſt. <hi>Ergo</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The propoſition is falſe: for not the decree of election, but the decree of iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an ſwerable to iuſtification: therefore if they would make this argument prooue any thing, they ſhould frame it thus: as we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in time, ſo God before the world de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to iuſtifie vs, but we are iuſtified for Chriſts merit, therefore ſo God decreed to do it. And this I graunt with all my hart: but this is not the queſtion in controuerſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. In whome we haue redemption and remiſſion of ſinnes, and in whome we are taken into the company of the Saints, in him we are elected. But by Chriſt apprehended by faith, we haue redemption &amp;c. therefore for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19839:27"/>him we are elected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I denie the concluſion, they put one thing in the propoſition and conclude another: for thus it ſhould followe, <hi>ergo</hi> we are elected in Chriſt, which in the ſenſe aboue ſhewed we confeſſe. For Paul teacheth the ſame to the Epheſians. 1. there are 4. <hi>termini.</hi> 1. in whome we haue redemption &amp;c. 2. to be elected in Chriſt. 3. to haue redemption for Chriſt. 4. to be elected for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4. If election be done without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſt laid hold on by faith, then alſo without reſpect of thoſe benefits which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Chriſt, as redemption and remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes. But not without theſe: for then we ſhould be ſaued without theſe, which is as blaſpemous as impoſſible. Therefore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I graunt the concluſion of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſyllogiſme, if it be rightly vnderſtood, for if election be made in Chriſt as Paul ſpeaks then not without Chriſt. But if their meaning is this, that electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not made but for Chriſts merit, I vtterlie denie it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a double ſignification in that phraſe <hi>(without reſpect of Chriſt)</hi> for there may be many and diuerſe reſpects of one &amp; the ſame thing, according to the manifold and diuerſe argumentes and mutuall affections in the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a ſtraunge kind of ſpeech in that phraſe (if election be made without reſpect or
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19839:27"/>looking vnto of Chriſt apprehended by faith.) For firſt it maie note, that God when he made election laid hold on Chriſt by faith, which is moſt fond to ſaie. 2. or if it be meant of men, it ſhould followe that before they were choſen they laid hold on Chriſt by faith, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. This they ſhould ſay if electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made for Chriſt, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould after apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by faith</p>
            <p n="4">4. Againe there is a double meaning in the conſequent of the propoſition. <hi>(Ergo alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beholding or reſpect of thoſe benefits that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Chriſt.)</hi> 1. that we are not elected to be made pertakers of redemption and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes. 2. or that we are not elected for redemption &amp;c. If it be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the firſt ſenſe, the conſequent will not followe of the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; in the ſecond it doth, if the antecedent be taken in this ſence, if election be made for Chriſts merit. But both waies is ſophiſtical for their double meaning.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſame amphibolie is in the aſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, for it may be vnderſtood 2. waies, either that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is made to that end, that we ſhould be partakers of his benefits, or that election is for thoſe benefits, as the moouing cauſe, which none will grant that is wel in his witts I trowe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the probatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the aſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nnex propoſition is falſe. There beeing a manifeſt confuſion of Gods decrees, making the decrees of election and redemption all one. But who ſees not they are ſeuerall. Therefore ſeeing there is no ſoundneſſe either in the principall ſyllogiſme, nor yet in the proſyllogiſme it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19839:28"/>it is a cleere caſe, that the Adverſaries opinion is verie falſe. And ſo is the fift falſe cauſe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, neither is the ende of election, the efficient cauſe of election. Becauſe God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne good pleaſure, would haue the ende firſt and principally: and then the meanes for the endes ſake.</p>
            <p>And thus we haue remooued the falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellent cauſes of election. Now let vs come to the true.</p>
            <p>The true efficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe then for which God elected vs is his onely good pleaſure groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon his meere loue &amp; mercie, according to theſe authorities. Luk. 12.32. <hi>Feare not little flocke, it pleaſeth the father to giue thee a kingdome.</hi> Rom. 11.5. <hi>therefore at this time there is a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation made according to his free election.</hi> Eph. 1.11. <hi>When we were predeſtinate according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that hath wrought all things according to the conſent of his owne will.</hi> and verſe 5. <hi>who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate vs whome he hath adopted into his ſonnes, through Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, after the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will.</hi> Deut. 7.7.8. <hi>Not becauſe ye vvere more then any other people, did the Lord affect and chooſe you, for you were the ſmalleſt of all people, but becauſe God had a loue vnto you.</hi> and 10.15. <hi>ſo greatly did the Lord loue your forefathers and like them, that he hath indeede choſen his ſeede after them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſide theſe teſtimonies of ſcripture, there are verie ſtrong reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:19839:28"/>
               <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. If Chriſt himſelfe as he was man did not deſerue to be made the ſonne of god, the head of the Angels, and mediator between God and man, but had that honour freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon him, then alſo is our election of free gift. But that is ſo. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Pſal. 2.9. it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he gaue him franke and free, a name that is aboue all names,</hi> that is, as he was God and man. Againe Saint Auſtin prooueth the ſame, tom. 7. lib. de praedeſt. Sanct. cap. 15. <hi>Looke how great ſoeuer he is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he is it by grace. why is grace diuerſe, where nature is common? ſurely there is no accepting of perſons with God: what man, that is a Chriſtian if he be well in his wits would ſay this. Therefore the very fountaine of grace appeareth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in our head, from whence he powreth vpon all his members according to euery ones meaſure. By that grace is euery one made a Chriſtian, ſo ſoone as euer he beleeues, by which grace that man from his firſt beginning was made Chriſt. Man is regenerate of the ſame ſparit, that he was generated, by the ſame ſpirit is made remiſſion of ſinnes in vs, by which it came to paſſe that he had no ſinne: theſe thinges God foreknew that he would doe. Therefore this is the predeſtination of the Saints, which was chiefly to be ſeene in the holie of holies: which none can denie that vnderſtand the ſayings of truth aright.</hi> And a little after: therefore this ſo great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious aduancement of his humane nature was predeſtinated, ſo high that it could goe no higher, as the divinitie alſo was abaſed ſo low that it could go no lower (for our ſake) then it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19839:29"/>went by meanes of the humane nature with the infirmitie of the fleſh euen to the death of the croſſe: therefore as that one was predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to be our head, ſo are manie of vs prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to be his members: as for mens merits let them be ſilent, which periſhed in Adam, &amp; let grace beare the ſway, which doth raigne by Ieſus Chriſt the Lord, and onely ſonne of god. VVhoſoeuer hath ſeene the foregoing merits of his ſingular generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him looke for the forenamed merits of manifold regeneration, in vs his members. For that generation of Chriſts was not rendred to him, but giuen, to be borne of the ſpirit and the virgine without all guilt of ſinne, ſo to vs it was not giuen for any merit of ours, but francke and free, to be regenerate of water and the ſpirit. And if faith hath brought vs to the waſhing of the newe birth, we muſt not preſently thinke, that we gaue him firſt, to be recompenſed againe with regeneration of ſaluation. For he cauſed vs to beleeue in Chriſt, that made Chriſt for vs in whome we doe beleeue. He maketh in men the beginning of faith and perfection in Ieſus, that made Ieſus man, the author and finiſher of faith, as he is called in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes.

            <p n="8">8 That we ſhould be holy, therefore freely: or els theſe two would be contrarie, that the godly haue it from election to be holy, and to come to it by meanes of workes.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The Patriarke Iacob was elect through grace: therefore election is of grace. For, Rom. 9.11. <hi>before the children were borne, when they had done neither good nor ill, that the purpoſe of God, which is according to his election, not of workes, but of him that calleth, might ſtand firme, it is ſaide vnto him, The elder ſhall ſerue the younger.</hi>

            <p>Againſt this the Aduerſaries alleadge:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. If the decree of election be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abſolute pleaſure, then is it not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19839:30"/>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his foreknowledge: but it is. The proofe of this propoſition is this. If in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute will there is nothing before or after, but in preſcience there is, then if election be according to his abſolute will, it is not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his preſcience: but that is ſo: therefore this. This aſſumption is confirmed by Pauls and Peters words, Rom. 8.29. <hi>whom he foreknew them he predeſtinated:</hi> and 1. Pet. 1.2. <hi>to thoſe that are elect according to his foreknowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. To auoide the fallacie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymie, wee muſt knowe that <hi>his pleaſure</hi> is ſaide to be abſolute, not becauſe it hath no cauſe at all, ſo much as in himſelfe; but for that the cauſe thereof, is not the condition of faith, or workes, or merits, or any other thing in the men that are to be choſen: and ſo we call this abſolute, not in the firſt but in the latter ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The connex of the principall ſyllogiſme is faultie for the ignorance of the elench, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his abſolute will and his preſcience in oppoſition one againſt another, not beeing contraries. For the <hi>knowledge</hi> according to which we are choſen, by an excellencie, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing els, then that ſpeciall knowledge which is ſpoken of, 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are his.</hi> that approbation loue, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly fauour which God extendeth to them that ſhall be ſaued. For thoſe he loueth, he is ſaide to know, and not to know and be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of other, Exod. 33.17. Pſal. 1.6. Matth. 7.27.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19839:30"/>therefore this foreknowledge is the cauſe of his will or good pleaſure. Therefore doth not diſprooue its owne effect.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Where it is ſaid in the connex of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllogiſme, that graunting preſcience, prioritie and poſterioritie is graunted; it is true in mans foreknowledge, but falſe in Gods. For when we aſcribe preſcience to God, our meaning is, that all things euerlaſtingly were, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſhall be vnder his eies, ſo that in reſpect of his knowledge, nothing was or ſhall be, but all things are actually preſent, and in ſuch ſort preſent, that he doth not imagine by the bare idees, as wee doe when wee remember any thing, but truly diſcerne and ſee, as if they were laid before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. If the onely will of God be the cauſe of election, then is their acception of perſons with God: but the Scripture ſaies he is accepter of no mans perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> They goe about to inſnare vs with an ambiguous word, taking <hi>[acception of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons]</hi> in an other ſenſe then the Scripture doth, ſpeaking of God. For the Scripture ſaying, God was no accepter of perſons, by the word <hi>[perſon]</hi> meanes not man, in which ſenſe the aduerſaries take it; but thoſe thinges that in man lying open to ſight vſe to procure them fauour, grace, and worſhippe, or elſe hatred, contempt, and ſhame. Such as are riches, wealth, power, nobilitie, office, countrie, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſhape, and ſo forth: or pouertie, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19839:31"/>baſenes, deformitie, contempt, and the like. So doth Peter, Act. 10.34. and Paul, Rom. 2.10. Gal. 3.28. ſhew that the Lord doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of no mans perſon, becauſe he puts no difference betweene Iew and Grecian, ſo that onely in regard of countrie, he ſhould take the one and refuſe the other. The ſame doth Iam. 2.5. affirming that God in iudging ſtands not vpon riches: and Paul, Eph. 6.9. and Coloſſ. 3.25. ſaies, there is no <hi>respect of perſons with God,</hi> becauſe he regards not in iudging bodily free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or ſeruitude.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The connex doth not follow. For then God is an accepter of perſons, if in one of the two whoſe meries are all alike, in one I ſay which is receiued, there were any thing to draw Gods liking to him: but if there be nothing at all, it follows that God lookes on no man, but hath his reaſon from his owne good will, why he maketh him his ſonne. Whereas then the one is taken, and the other not, it proceedes not from any reſpect of man, but from the ſole mercie of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1. Here they replie thus: If God kept the ſame courſe in his predeſtination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all men, then indeede he were not an accepter of perſons: as for example; if finding all faultie ſhe ſhould puniſh all alike, or elſe if innocent, he ſhould forbeare all: but that he doth not: <hi>ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> the connex is not ſimplie but in ſome ſort, If God ſhould beare the ſame hand
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19839:31"/>oward all men, that is, if he had pleaſed to mitigate the rigour of his inſtice with mixture of mercie. But they handle God, as if they would forbid him to vſe mercie, or when he would vſe clemencie, would conſtraine him totally to renounce iudgement. 2 Wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all are guiltie, but we ſay and ſay it with ioy of heart, that Gods mercie doth ſuccour ſome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. Againe they vrge. Then let him haue mercie on all.</p>
            <p>I <hi>anſwer,</hi> 1. God is in debt to no man, becauſe no man gaue vnto him firſt, that he might challenge his owne. 2. It is equitie, that euen in puniſhing he ſhould ſhew himſelfe an equal iudge: which while the aduerſaries will not ſuffer him to doe, what els doe they but goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to robbe God of his mercie, or els at leaſt with this condition to yeeld it him, that he quite relinquiſh iudgement.</p>
            <p>Therefore let this remaine immooueable, that the cauſe for which we are elected, is the free mercie of God onely. And thus much of the efficient cauſe of election of ſuch men that ſhall be ſaued, nowe ſee wee the other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>matter</hi> of eternall election, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, appointment, purpoſe,<note place="margin">2. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial cauſe of election.</note> or counſell of God, that is to ſay, the iudgement as it were of the heauenly minde of thoſe that ſhall be ſaued. Some ſay, the matter of election, are the elect: but they take the word <hi>matter</hi> in an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19839:32"/>other ſenſe, namely, the matter about which, or the <hi>obiect.</hi> We by that name, meane the <hi>cauſe.</hi> And ſome againe, that the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote of election is <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he is Mediatour, and they alſo vſe the word abuſiuely for the <hi>ſubiect</hi> in which, or the matter wherein. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine they ſay, the next matter of our election is the death and obedience of Chriſt, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede is not the <hi>matter</hi> but the <hi>effect</hi> of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For to this ende did Chriſt die for vs, and was obedient to his father, becauſe we were eternally elected.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cauſe of election.</note>The <hi>forme</hi> of eternall election, is the putting a difference between certain men that ſhould be taken to ſaluation, from other that ſhould periſh: or, the ordaining out of the generall number, of ſome certaine men, who beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered out of the generall deſtruction ſhould be taken to ſaluation. Againe other ſay, the remooued forme of election is the adoption into the ſonnes of God, the nearer, our vnion with Chriſt. But theſe are nothing but <hi>effects</hi> of election, and not <hi>formall</hi> cauſes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. The final cauſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note>The <hi>ende</hi> of eternall election is double: 1. the glorie of God, that is, the manifeſtation and celebration of the grace and mercie of God in his Church. For God did chooſe ſome to make <hi>knowne the riches of his glorie, towards the veſſells of mercie, which he hath prepared vnto glory.</hi> Rom. 9.23. <hi>And he hath predeſtinate vs, whom he hath adopted into himſelfe to be ſonnes through Ieſus Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19839:32"/>will to the praiſe of his glorious grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2 An other ende of election, is the glorie of the elect, Rom. 9.23. he ſaith, the <hi>elect are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto glorie.</hi> Nowe this glorie of the elect, containes both ſaluation, and the meanes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto. Therefore the elect are ſaid to be <hi>elected to eternall life,</hi> Act. 13.48. Elect <hi>to this to be holy and vnblameable before God with loue,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>made in Chriſt Ieſus to good works, which God hath prepared that they ſhould walke in them,</hi> Eph. 2.10.</p>
            <p>Election then is not Gods ſimple will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any end. For to imagine ſuch a will in God as hath no purpoſed ende, is impious. For if nature doth nothing in vaine, how much leſſe God?</p>
            <p>Thus much of the cauſes of election: now follow the effects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>effects</hi> of election are theſe. The media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, adoption, effectuall vocation, ſauing faith, iuſtification, and glorification. And theſe effects are the meanes and degrees by which God doth bring his elect vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the ladder of ſaluation, or the meanes of bringing our election to the ende thereof. Therfore eternal predeſtination is the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke and fountaine of all Gods ſauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Chriſts mediation</hi> is the firſt effect of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For the cauſe why Chriſt is our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, is our election.</p>

               <note place="margin">Effects of Election.</note>2 <hi>Adoption,</hi> is our receiuing into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſonnes of God: which Paul teſtifies is an effect of election, Eph. 1.5. ſaying, <hi>that God hath predeſtinated vs, whome he hath adopted into his ſonnes by Chriſt into him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Of <hi>effectuall vocation,</hi> which is wrought by the preaching of the word of God, in our heart by the holy ſpirit, as Paul ſpeaketh, ſaying, Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 8.30. <hi>whom he hath predeſtinated, thoſe alſo hath he called:</hi> &amp; our Lord himſelfe, Ioh. 6.37. <hi>what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my father giueth me ſhall come vnto me.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is by the arbitreinent of eternall electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the goſpel of life is preached to ſome, &amp; findeth place with them, &amp; is not preached to other, or beeing preached is not receiued.</p>

For they were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, becauſe they had not bin idolaters, but therefore they were no idolaters: <hi>ergo</hi> they were the Church, becauſe they were elect. Hence it alſo appeares, that whoſoeuer are predeſtinate to ſaluation, they are all predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate alſo to the meanes of obtaining ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore as the elect doe neceſſarily come in the ende to ſaluation, for the firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of election; ſo alſo they muſt of neceſſitie be lead and walke by the meanes ordained to ſaluation, for the ſame firmenes ſake.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the effects of election. Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſubiects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſubiect in whome</hi> we are elect is <hi>Christ,</hi> not as he is God,<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> or the Word, for in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he choſe vs, Ioh. 13.18. <hi>I know whome I haue choſen</hi> nor yet as he is man, for being no more but man, he was no meete ſubiect for vs to be choſe in: but as he is <hi>God and man,</hi> our head and euerlaſting mediatour, who for that cauſe as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> doth relate, was prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated mediatour, and the glaſſe of predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Now this is the cauſe why we are elected in him, 1. becauſe in our ſelues wee were not capable of ſuch excellencie: 2. becauſe he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19839:34"/>alone is a fit meane for vs to be choſen in, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in election our vnion and coniunctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with God that choſe vs, was made.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

The promiſe of ſaluation is not made generally to all, no not by preaching or declaration, but onely to thoſe to whome the preaching or declaring of the promiſe is from euerlaſting predeſtinate, and therefore to ſuch as indeede it is preached and declared.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:19839:36"/>thoſe, that are inwardly renued and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the image of god by the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But in the aſſumption by a metonymie ſuch as are out wardly waſhed in baptiſme. For it is vſuall to call the baptizing of water rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and thoſe that are baptized with water to ſay they are regenerated, as Iuſtine Martyr ſpeaketh in his ſecond apologie for the chriſtians to Antonius Pius. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhalbee perſuaded and beleeue ſtedfaſtly, that the things are true which we teach and deliuer, and ſhall take vpon them to liue thereafter, we inſtruct them with faſting to pray and aske thoſe things at the hands of God, &amp; the remiſſion of their former ſinnes, with whome we alſo do faſt and pray: then wee carrie them to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there they are regenerated vvith the ſame kinde of regeneration that we are: for they are then waſhed in water in the name of the father our Lord and creator of all things, and of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and of the holie ghoſt.</hi> And a little after that he ſaith, <hi>that waſhing is called enlightening, for that their mindes are enlightened, that learne theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Therefore the baptiſme of water is called rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and illumination, not properly, but by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie, becauſe it is a ſacrament of the powring out of the holy ghoſt, vvho doth properly regenerate vs.</hi> Therefore the propoſition is onely true of ſuch, as not onely are regenerate with the outward ſacrament, but inwardly in their hearts by the ſpirit of adoption: but the aſſumption is true of all, ſo farre forth as they are regenerated but with the ſacrament; but if you take it ſimplie it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19839:37"/>is not true. For many want the inner regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, that had the outward, as Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Iſcariot, Simon Magus &amp;c.</p>

And that this is his meaning, is euident by his drift, becauſe he threatens very grieuous puniſhment to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolters

And leaſt any man ſhould thinke it were but a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle to goe back, he doth exaggerate this ſinne, ſhewing that the contempt of baptiſme, by which they were initiated, was the contempt of Chriſt, <hi>and to account the blood of the teſtament an vnholy thing</hi> is ſaid in the ſame ſenſe that 1.

And this doth the aſſumption af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme ſimply, as if indeede they were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by him: which is flat contrarie to other places of the ſcripture, Apoc. 14.3, 4.

If God doth allow &amp; like of this requeſt: which God did not, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him thus. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me I ſhould blott out of my book.</hi> Cyprian in his 2. book <hi>de lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſaieth thus. He was Gods friend, he talked face to face with God, he could not haue his petition, neither did he appeaſe Gods wrath with his prayer. So then out of this petition of Moſes, being conditionall and not liked nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we cannot inferr that Moſes could, or that the elect can be ſcraped out of the booke of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 1.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19839:43"/>repentance: which Iohn calls <hi>the ſinne vnto death,</hi> and neuer falls vnto the elect. 1. Ioh. 3.9. Againe they vrge.

For ſuch remaining in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church, and hauing an externall profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, both thinke themſelues they are &amp; ſo do othermen take them ſo, when to ſay truely it is nothing ſo. And ſo doth S.

And a little after: this was ſaid according to their hope, becauſe they thought they were written in it: what is <hi>let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be blotted out?</hi> this: let it appeare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that they are not there. For the verſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes expounds that, <hi>and let them not be written with the iuſt:</hi> for this I ſaide let them be blotted
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19839:43"/>out, according to their owne hope, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy iuſtice what ſay I? let them not bee written in: thus much for S. Auſtin.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Yet further they alleadge. Apoc. 3.5. <hi>He that ouercomes ſhalbe cloathed in white garments, &amp; I will neuer put out his name out of the booke of life:</hi> therefore God doth put them out that doe not ouercome, but ſuffer themſelues to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the deuill and other ſpiritual enemies, and ſinne againſt God. To this I ſay. 1. the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is doubtfull. For if they meane, that god wil ſhew that they that do not ouercome are not written in the booke of life, we graunt it, but if they vnderſtand it thus, that God will ranch them out that are once writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is falſe: for they that do not overcome, but ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be overcome of the deuill and ſinne againſt God, they are neuer written, as the Lord ſpeaketh Ezech. 13.9. <hi>They ſhall not be in the count of my people, and ſhall not be written in the catalogue of the houſe of Jſrael, neither ſhall they come into the houſe of Iſrael:</hi> that is, neither ſhall be, in the booke of life, nor ſhall obtaine the deliuerance, but remaine eſtraunged from the church, and the viſible ſignes of the ſame, and God and all. 2. Here is an elench of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; for he that over commeth, &amp; he that doth not overcome are not like in that whereon this conſequence doth depend. For both are not written in the booke of life: which if both were, it would follow of the contrary ſenſe, he that overcomes ſhall not be blotted, <hi>ergo</hi> he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19839:44"/>that doth not, ſhall.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The aſſumption is falſe. 2. the place of Paule doth not proue it, for he doth not ſay he can be, but wiſheth he might: that is, by an earneſt and enflamed zeale deſires his owne deſtruction, that he might (though it were with his owne loſſe) aduance the glorie and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in preſeruing of Iſrael. Yea but he wiſheth he were, and therefore might be. He doth it not ſimplie but with condition, as if he had ſaid, I wiſh my ſelfe alone were rather depriued of that euerlaſting felicitie which I ſhall haue with Chriſt, if it were poſſible, then that ſo many of my brethren the Iſraelites ſhould be ſhutt from grace, and ſo the name of Chriſt and the glorie of God ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into queſtion: for this is a true teſtimonie of true loue indeed when a man makes no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his owne ſaluation, in reſpect of Chriſts honor and glorie and the ſaluation of other men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. 1. Cor. 9.29. <hi>J beat downe my bodie</hi> (ſaith Paule) <hi>and keepe it in ſubiection, leaſt by anie meanes, vvhen J haue preached vnto other I ſhould be a reprobate my ſelfe. Ergo.</hi> the elect may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:19839:44"/>2. there is an homonymie in the word <hi>(repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate)</hi> for in the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſignifies ſuch an one as is paſſed ouer by God, and is oppoſed to one that is elected vnto ſaluation, but in Pauls ſpeech it ſtandes for him, as by experience is prooued not to be the man he ſhould be, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially he himſelfe ſetting downe the rule of holy life vnto other, that is, obſerues not that himſelfe that he preſcribes other: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a badde teacher is vnworthie to bee made of, but is ſuch as very worthily deſerues to be reiected of all men. And ſo the worde <gap reason="foreign">

So Ier. 6.30. <hi>the ſiluer is called reprobate,</hi> that is not ſo good as it ſhould bee, and therefore worthie to be caſt away. <hi>And the earth reprobate.</hi> Heb. 6.8. that is, badde &amp; not worth the tilling and ſowing, ſith it brings forth nothing but thornes and thiſtles. The meaning then is this, I preſcribe other men a ſquare to liue after, therefore I labour to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my ſelfe in ſuch ſort, that my dealings ſhall be anſwerable to my doctrine, and that I may not ſeeme to neglect that my ſelfe which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of other men, to mine owne reproach &amp; other mens offence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though I ſhould grant that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of reprobation to eternal death, yet he ſheweth not here what is done, but what is not done concerning himſelfe, as he ſaieth, 2. Cor. 13.6. <hi>but I hope ye ſhall knowe that we are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19839:45"/>not reprobates.</hi> and Rom. 8.28. he ſpeakes more plainely. Therefore the conſequence is too weake. Paul laboured that he ſhould not be a reprobate, therefore he might be one. For this care of his doth not fight againſt the certentie of election, but rather is thereby confirmed. For as God would haue perſeuerance to be ſtable, ſo would he haue it cheriſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by this godly care and indeauour, 2. Pet. 1.10. <hi>Labour to make your election ſure.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The argument is ambiguous. For in the propoſition, the word <hi>righteous,</hi> ſignifies him that is truly righteous, that is, freely iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God for Chriſts ſake: and <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes</hi> ſtands for that bleſſing of free remiſſion of ſinnes, obtained at the hands of God for Chriſts ſake. But in the aſſumption and place out of the Prophet, the firſt ſignifies him that is iuſt onely in his owne opinion, as hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and thoſe that beleeue for a time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſlide backe. For he that is righteous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, <hi>is like a tree planted by the riuers of waters, whoſe leaues ſhall neuer fall away.</hi> Pſal. 1.3. <hi>he ſhall he had in euerlaſting remembrance,</hi> Pſal. 1.12.6. <hi>his righteouſneſſe remaineth for euer,</hi> v. 3. <hi>and he ſhall not die.</hi> But of him that is ſuch but in ſhew, thus the Lord ſpeaketh in Ezekiel, <hi>his righteouſneſſe which he hath done ſhall not be remembred:</hi> againe, <hi>he ſhall die.</hi> Therefore he ſpeaketh of ſuch who in their owne conceit and other mens are iuſt. Of whome Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I came not to call the iust but ſinners to repentance:</hi> and not of them that are ſuch indeede. Againe, iuſtice in the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Prophets wordes, is not free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſinnes, but works in ſhew righteous, ſuch as hypocrites doe.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The argument here againe is doubtfull.

Anſ.</hi> There is a fallacie in the word <hi>[branch]</hi> by which name all ſuch are called, as are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally called to Chriſt and make, profeſſion. But they are not branches. For the Lord makes an expreſſe difference of branches. Some fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and other not. Of theſe he ſaith they are caſt forth of the vineyard, wither, are gathered together, caſt into the fire and burnt. Such are meant in the propoſition. 2. The aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is falſe, becauſe all the elect are fruitfull branches, which the father doth daily purge more and more to bring forth more fruit, ſo farre are they from beeing plucked vp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> They prooue the aſſumption thus. They that are regenerate in Chriſt aliue, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: but vnfruitfull branches were regenerate in Chriſt aliue: <hi>ergo</hi> vnfruitfull branches were elect. Bellarmines proofe is this. Becauſe it cannot be a branch, that did not ſometime liue in the vine. For branches are not grafted in from any other where, but ſpring out of the vine, and ſpring out aliue and not dead. So then are the faithfull regenerate in Chriſt, and when they are borne anew they are not dead but aliue: and yet if after their regeneration they will bring forth no fruit of good workes, they wither, are cut away, and die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There are many faults in this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1. Falſe application of the ſimilitude that Chriſt vſeth. For Chriſt doth not compare
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19839:47"/>thoſe that are called vnto him vnto branches, becauſe they are not grifted in from other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but are borne aliue out of him. For all his branches are grifted in; for they ſpring out of Adams ſtocke, but by grace are ſet into Chriſt. 2. It is falſely ſuppoſed that all bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are borne againe and liue in Chriſt: for none but the fruitfull doe ſo. 3. It is more falſe that the regenerate will not, or refuſe to bring forth the fruit of good workes. 4. But moſt of all falſe that the regenerate doe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are cut off, and die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> They vige againe that the Lord doth not onely ſay that the branch that doth wither ſhall be ſeparated from the vine, but moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they <hi>ſhall gather it, caſt it into the fire, and it ſhall burne.</hi> And therefore he that hath once bin a branch in the vine, that is, a member in the bodie of Chriſt by a liuely faith, may be caſt into the fire and their burne for euer. <hi>Anſ.</hi> To which I ſay, 1. it followes not; for the ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent ſpeakes of an vnfruitfull branch, the conſequent of a fruitfull; that ſhall indeede be caſt into the fire, ſo ſhall not this. 2. A branch in the vine is defined to be a member in the bodie of Chriſt by a liuely faith, which defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not large ynough, containing onely one kinde, namely the fruitfull onely: but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all ſuch are called braunches that are externally called to Chriſt by the preaching, ioyned to the viſible Church, and profeſſing faith in Chriſt: whome the Lord himſelfe doth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19839:48"/>diſtinguiſh into fruitfull and vnfruitfull. And ſo may dead members alſo be ingrafted into the viſible Church.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 They alleadge Chriſts teſtimonie falſely. For whereas the aſſumption ſaith, that ſome of the elect doe not perſiſt vnto the ende, Chriſt ſaith not ſo, but to thoſe that do, he promiſeth life.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. There is ambiguitie in the phraſe <hi>[to be aboliſhed from Chriſt, and to fall from grace.]</hi> For in the ſyllogiſme they ſignifie to be ſeparated from that coniunction with Chriſt, which in truth they had, and to fall from grace wherein a man truly was. But in Paul they ſignifie that Chriſt is made vnprofitable vnto them, to be excluded from Chriſts communion,<note place="margin">Grace.</note> not to be partaker of him, and to haue no ſocietie with him. And to <hi>fall from grace,</hi> is to fall from the Goſpel, which they had before time receiued (for <hi>grace</hi> here is the doctrine of the Goſpel, ſet againſt the law) to haue refuſed the grace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:19839:49"/>in the Goſpel. 2. The aſſumption is falſe. 3 Paul ſpeakes of the reprobate, not of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> Yes of the elect: for they that are truly in Chriſt and in grace, are elect: theſe were ſuch: <hi>ergo.</hi> for they fell from it: therefore they had bin truly in it. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The aſſumption is falſe againe. 2 The proofe that is brought doth not prooue it: becauſe it is borrowed out of Pauls teſtimonie not rightly tranſlated. For Ierome doth flatly reprooue the vulgar tranſlation, turning it, <hi>you haue ceaſed from the worke of Chriſt,</hi> not ſo well, but yet ſo, as that hereby we may perceiue he is not the author of the common tranſlation: 2. becauſe of the amphibolie or doubtfull taking of the phraſe, as I ſaide euen now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But they fell from it: therefore they were in it.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is an homonymie in the word <hi>[faith,]</hi> for in the firſt part of the propoſition it ſignifies the true and wholeſome doctrine of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19839:49"/>God: but in the ſecond, the certen perſuaſion of Gods election and mercie. 2. The aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is falſe. 3. The places doe not prooue it: for they ſpeake not of the elect, nor yet of this perſwaſion of the heart of Gods mercie: but by a metonymie, wholeſome doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Teſt.</hi> 10. They that fall may looſe faith: the elect may fall, Hebr. 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>It can not be that they that once haue bin inlightened, and haue taſted of that heauenly gift, and haue bin partakers of the holy spirit, and haue taſted the good vvord of God and the vertues of the world to come, if they fall, ſhould be renewed againe to repentance. ergo</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The propoſition is falſe: for they that fal, neuer had that ſauing faith: therefore can not looſe it. 2 So is the aſſumption: for it is impoſſible the elect ſhould fall, that is, finallie fall for euer from the Goſpel. 3. The teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie alleadged will not prooue it, the queſtion beeing of the Elect and this beeing ſpoken of Apoſtates and temporarie men: and therfore of the reprobate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> But here they take exception that Paule ſpeaketh of the elect. They that are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iuſtified, enlightened, haue taſted the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly gift and are partakers of the holy ghoſt, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: but theſe of whome Paule ſpeakes are ſuch: <hi>ergo</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The argument conſiſtes of very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and differing points. For <hi>to be truely iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> is the propertie of the elect, and therefore as many as are truely iuſtified are elect, as that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19839:50"/>golden chaine of our ſaluation doth ſhew, Ro. 8.30. <hi>thoſe whome he hath predeſtinated, he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſocalled:</hi> (namely according to the purpoſe of eternal predeſtination,) and <hi>whome he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoſe he hath iuſtified, and whome he hath iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he hath alſo glorified.</hi> Now the other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, are either ambiguous or obſcure. For <hi>to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened</hi> in this place ſignifies either to know the doctrine of the goſpell, or els it ſignifies by a metonymie to be baptized, as the <hi>Syrian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter doth expound it: becauſe of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the baptiſme of perſons of age that were catechized, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p n="2">2. Theſe things be common to the elect &amp; reprobate: and ſo hauing diſtinguiſhed &amp; laid open the arguments, it is an eaſie matter to anſwer the premiſes ſeuerally. The propoſition is partly true and partly falſe. This is true, they that are truely iuſtified are elect: but all the reſt is falſe, they that are enlightened and are elect: for both ſorts haue theſe alike, but the elect
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19839:50"/>reſt not here but proceed further: ſo likewiſe is the aſſumption in part true and in part falſe: it is true, that theſe of whome the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth are enlightened &amp; the reſt, but falſe that they are truely iuſtified: for no ſyllable here ſoundes to that. 3. Bellarmine doth wrong here to Paules wordes ſaying <hi>impoſſible,</hi> is as much as moſt hard &amp; rare, which is farre from the ſignification of that word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> They for whome Chriſt was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are elect, but Chriſt was crucified for theſe: <hi>ergo.</hi> becauſe Paule ſaies, <hi>they crucifie againe to themſelues the ſonne of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The aſſumption is falſe. Againe there is a double amphibolie in this: one from the fallacie of compoſition and diuiſion. For in that aſſumption that word <hi>(againe)</hi> is not to be conſtrued with that <hi>(to themſelues)</hi> but with the <hi>verb (crucifie)</hi> being in the greeke <hi>(recrucifying,)</hi> the ſecond is of the phraſe, <hi>crucifie againe to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So ſaith Paule, Gal. 6.14. <hi>that the world was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to him and he to the world,</hi> that is, as he was deſpiſed of the world, ſo he againe deſpiſed the world: as the Iewes cared not for Chriſt whome they crucified.</p>

               <hi>they crucifie again,</hi> therefore Chriſt was once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truely crucified for them.</p>
            <p>

For they are ſaid <hi>to crucifie Chriſt to themſelues,</hi> who of a malicious hate make a mocke of Chriſt crucified, which the wicked Iewes did once before; &amp; the apoſtates do again. If Chriſt had beene once alreadie crucifie him to themſelues, that is, make light account of him, but loue &amp; honor him very much.</p>
            <p>Teſtimonie 11. They that ſinne willingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue receaued the knowledge of the trueth, looſe faith: the elect do ſo. Heb. 10.26. <hi>To vs that ſinne willingly after we haue receaued the knowledge of the trueth, there is no ſacrifice left for ſinne, but a fearefull expectation of iudgement &amp;c. Ergo.</hi>

            <p>Teſtimonie 12.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Here are to many interrogatories, for the iuſtifying faith which cannot bee loſt is one queſtion, and the loue of God either as a creator, or as a redeemer is another. The loue of God as a creator may be loſt, as the euil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels haue loſt it, but the loue of God as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer cannot, being a neceſſary and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effect of iuſtifying faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The example of the euill angels is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the matter: for the queſtion is whether men elected may looſe their iuſtifying faith, but euill angells are neither men nor elect: nether euer had they or could haue iuſtifying faith, ſeing the promiſe was not made to them to giue them righteouſnes by Chriſt, nor yet are iuſtified for or by him.</p>

            <p n="2">2. It is not vniuerſally true, ſuch habits may bee loſt as are gott by our owne induſtrie and is not confirmed in mans minde by God: but faith is not gott by our labour, but infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and it is confirmed in whomſoeuer hath it, by God, that it may perſeuere. <hi>For thoſe that God doeth iuſtifie, hee doeth alſo ſanctifie.</hi> Rom. 8 30.</p>

               <hi>Arſ.</hi> Hee ſaies the maior is true by the ſcripture, and the aduerſaries doctrine, which is, that iuſtifying faith is ſhaken out, and the holie ghoſt poured forth of the heart by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſinne.

As Dauid did not preſently put off all clemencie, when he cauſed Vrias to bee ſlaine: nor caſt away all faith in God, when hee fledd for feare of Saul to the Philiſtines. In the proofe of the maior, he appeals very impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the teſtimonie of the ſcripture, which hee hath none: and to the aduerſaries on whome he fathers a lie, aſcribing that doctrine to vs which we renounce.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The minor is alſo falſe, and fooliſh the proofe: for a habit is a qualitie imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our mindes, and ſuch an affection as bringeth not onely propenſion and alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of minde to doe the ſame thing alwaies, but alſo a ſetled reſolution &amp; grounded, and deſire of our will, and doeth not admit the reaſons and motions of the contrary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo Bellarmine leaues vs to skanne, whether hee is a worſe diuine or a more ſottiſh philoſopher.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19839:62"/>but they ſhould not be ſo muſt afraide of it, becauſe the holy Scripture it ſelfe doth vſe it.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, reprobates.</p>
               <p>There are two parts of reprobation: firſt, a deputation to reproach, that is, both to vſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, or to thoſe works which the reprobates doe commit afterward, and alſo to eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: ſecondly, Reiection from the grace of election, and the effects of the ſame grace, and ſo from the ende eternall life.</p>
               <p>Deſtination to ſhame, is before reiection from the grace of election. For that which is laſt in execution, is firſt in intention, that is, in counſell and cogitation. See Zanch. <hi>de natura Dei.</hi> p. 506.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his third tome of diſputations, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de grat. &amp; lib. arbitr. cap.</hi> 16. ſaith, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation compriſeth two acts in it: one nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, the other poſitiue. For firſt he ſaith God had no will to ſaue them: 2. had a will to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them. All which we would haue liked well, but that he inuerted the order of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for that which he ſets firſt, indeede is laſt. Againe, we like not his making of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on double, one negatiue, the other affirmatiue,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19839:63"/>calling that privatiue, this poſitiue. But other call that paſſiue, this actiue. For euery thing that conſiſteth of two parts, is not two-fold. There is but one eternall reprobation, not two, and that hath but one obiect and no more.</p>
               <p>Eternall reprobation is 1. of the deuill: 2. thoſe that are vnited to the deuill.</p>
               <p>Reprobation of the deuill, is that whereby God from euerlaſting hath reiected the deuill that ſhould become the prince and head of falling from God, and hath adiudged him to euerlaſting puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Reprobation of them that are vnited to the deuill, is of ſuch as are ioyned to the deuill as their prince and head: and it is either of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill angels, or damned men. Mat. 25.41. Gen. 3.15. Ioh. 8.14.</p>
               <p>The eternall reprobation of euill angels is predeſtination, whereby God from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting decreed to forſake ſome angels ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eternall deſtruction, not to confirme them in good, to ſuffer them to fall through pride, and caſting them from heauen to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from eternall happines. Math. 25.41. Apoc. 12.9.</p>
               <p>That there is a reprobation of ſome of the angels is euident by this, becauſe ſome angels are elected, by Pauls witnes: now election can not ſtand without reprobation.</p>
               <p>Concerning the cauſe thereof, Bellarmine is of this iudgement, that the negatiue repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19839:63"/>of the angels, doth not depend on the foreſight of ſinne. For God foreſaw that the angels which periſh ſhould moſt vndoubtedly periſh, if indeede he ſhould giue them but that grace onely which he did giue them, therfore giuing them no more grace, he would withall not predeſtinate them to glorie, but ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fal from ſaluation. For if he would abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue ſaued them, his wiſdome would haue found a meanes to doe it. Therefore there can be no reaſon giuen, why God would giue ſome angels grace, by which hee ſawe they ſhould moſt certenly be ſaued, and to other whereby hee ſawe moſt certenly they ſhould not, but onely becauſe he would ſaue theſe and not them. But the cauſe why he would poſitiuely damne the euill angels was out of doubt their ſinne foreſeene. For the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of condemnation is not iuſtly inflicted, but where ſinne went before. Nowe in this we like it well, that he acknowledgeth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe why ſome angels were not elected to ſaluation, but onely the meere will of God. But we very much miſlike, firſt that he makes two kindes of reprobation in ſtead of the two parts of one and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lfe ſame thing: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he makes foreſight of ſinne the cauſe of his will in condemning the euill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſeeing it is impoſſible that the efficient cauſe ſhould in time be after the effect. And it is very groſſe that the ſinne ſhould be the efficient cauſe of the eternall will of God,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19839:64"/>that is, of Gods very eſſence, willing. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he brings is beſide the point, becauſe the puniſhment of damnation is one thing, and the eternall decree of inflicting the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment of damnation is an other. Indeede God decreed to lay the puniſhment on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills for ſinne, but ſinne is not therefore the cauſe of the decree. Sinne is the cauſe of puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment, but not of the decree of puniſhing.</p>
               <p>The eternall predeſtination of men to be condemned, is that predeſtination whereby God hath determined fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting to paſſe by thoſe that are left in the common deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into which all men ſhould plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by ſinne.</p>
               <p n="1">1 There are two parts of this definition, the <hi>genus,</hi> and the difference: or, the matter and the forme.

                     </gap>ie according to God. Which myſtically we call two cities, that is, two ſocieties of men, the one whereof is predeſtinated to raigne for euer with God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vndergoe euerlasting torment with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</hi> And againe in his <hi>Enchirid.</hi> to <hi>Laurentius,</hi> cap. 100. God ſhould bring to paſſe that which he would, vſing well euen the euill, as chiefly good to their condemnation, whome he iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predeſtinated to puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; to the others ſaluation, whome in mercie he predeſtinated
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19839:64"/>to grace. And the author of the booke of the calling of the Gentiles, calls the reprobate predeſtinate. So doth <hi>Fulgentius ad Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. Therefore ſinners, ſaith he, are not predeſtinated to the firſt death of the ſoule, that is, ſinne; but to the ſecond, the ſtate of fire and brimſtone. And in the ſecond booke to the ſame man; Gods predeſtination is nothing elſe, but the preparation of his workes which in his euerlaſting diſpoſition he foreknew he would doe either mercifully or iuſtly. And <hi>Anſelmus</hi> in his booke of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of preſcience and free will, ſaith, Predeſtination is not onely of the good, but of the badde alſo. So doe the ſchoolemen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame name of predeſtination, deliuer as well the reprobation of the wicked, as the election of Saints. Therefore we doe not ſo ill, in vſing the word predeſtination for repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to deſtruction: nor yet doe we foiſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church any new opinions of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall predeſtination of the reprobate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, as the aduerſaries charge vs: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will likewiſe accuſe Auguſtine, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius, and the other fathers for the ſame fault. Againe, whereas ſome would haue the reprobate called <hi>[foreknovvne]</hi> rather, indeede they know not what they ſay, for that Chriſt and the Elect are called <hi>foreknovvne</hi> both in Scripture and by Iuſtin Martyr, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Apolog.</hi> and in his dialogue with Trypho the Iewe; ſo are not the reprobate once in all the Scripture,

               <p n="2">2 The forme or difference to diſtinguiſh reprobation of men condemned, from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall election, is, that God determined and appointed to reiect and exclude thoſe men whome he prepared to euerlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the communion of eternall ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>So then there are two parts of reprobation of men to be damned, 1. deputing them to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominie, and ſo to euerlaſting deſtruction: 2. excluding them from grace of election, and the effects thereof.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Of the ſecond part Chriſt ſpeaketh, Ioh. 13.18. <hi>I ſpeake not of you all, I know whome I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi> Mat. 20.16. <hi>Many are called, but few are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi> Math. 15.13. <hi>There are plants which the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father hath not planted.</hi> Apoc. 13.8. <hi>All the inhabitants of the earth ſhall worſhippe the beaſt, vvhoſe names are not vvritten in the booke of life

               <p>That there is reprobation, both the ſcripture doth affirme and other arguments proue: the places of ſcripture are theſe.

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. God is not delighted with the deſtruction of a ſinner, Ezek. 18.23. and 32. Pſal. 5.5. Wiſd. 1.13. <hi>ergo</hi> he is not the author of eternall reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The propoſition that is wanting is falſe for the elench of the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g cauſe: becauſe it ſuppoſeth that the delight of the deſtruction of the wicked is the cauſe for which God reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them. 2. The aſſumption muſt be taken but in part: for God is not delighted with their deſtruction as it is deſtruction, but as it is the execution of his iuſt iudgement. 3. There is an homonymie in the place alleadged out of Ezekiel: for there God ſpeakes of the wicked
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19839:70"/>that is conuerted; with his death he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, nor wills his death. Therefore it is not truly cited of the deſtruction of the reprobate, who neuer turne, and of whome the holy Ghoſt pronounceth the cleane contrarie, Pro. 1.24. <hi>I will laugh at your deſtruction, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The place out of the Pſalme is impertinent: for is eternall reprobation, vanitie, or iniquitie? 5. To the place out of Wiſdome, the anſwer to Ezekiel will ſerue.</p>
               <p>The moouing cauſe for which eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation was made, is not ſinne: for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtanding whereof, I will explane this poſition.</p>
               <p>Whomſoeuer God condemneth and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with eternall death, thoſe he decreed to condemne euerlaſtingly &amp; puniſh with death, ſo that the immediat cauſe of damnation and puniſhment is ſinne. But this is not now the queſtion, but onely what is the cauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, why God when he foreſaw that all men would be ſinners alike in Adam, and by nature the children of wrath, determined to ſhew his mercie in the one, &amp; to leaue the other in their ſinnes and condemne them for the ſame? there can be no other cauſe tendred of it, but Gods pleaſure only. Yet more plainly. Why did God chooſe the one, and refuſe the other, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to caſt off them, to leaue them in their ſinnes, and for their ſinnes to condemne them, when as the Elect ſhould haue bin no leſſe the children of wrath by nature then all other? I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19839:71"/>
                  <hi>anſwer,</hi> becauſe it ſo pleaſed him. It can not be anſwered it was for ſinne, becauſe ſinne was to be in the elect alſo. If here any doe obiect, that there is a difference betweene the elect and the reprobate, becauſe the elect were to declare their repentance, and to beleeue firmely and conſtantly in Chriſt, and ſo were not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, yet that doth not take away my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. For ſtill the queſtion remaines, why God gaue vnto the elect the gift of repentance and conſtant faith, and not to the reprobate? Whereunto no other anſwer can be made but this, that it pleaſed God ſo. As that onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of ours teacheth vs, Math. 11.25. <hi>I giue thee glorie O father, Lord of heauen and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt reuealed them to babes: euen ſo O Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was thy good pleaſure before thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we ſee how vniuſtly our aduerſaries doe ſlaunder our doctrine, ſaying, that wee teach, that God by a certaine kinde of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decree, hath ordained ſome to eternall deſtruction, without any reſpect of ſinne, or regarde of vnbeleefe and vnrepentance. Whereas we teach, that God hath reprobated, that is, decreed to leaue the reprobate in the deſtruction, whereinto they ſhould volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily plunge themſelues, and to condemne them <hi>for ſinne,</hi> and puniſh them with euerlaſting puniſhment. He decreed, I ſay, to condemne and puniſh for ſinne.</p>
               <p>This did Zanchius plainely teach, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19839:71"/>natura Dei, cap.</hi> 2. and lib. 3. of his Miſcellan. pag. 53. of the edition ſet forth 1592.</p>
               <p>So doe the Palatine Diuines, as the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>Neuſtad</hi> witneſſeth, pag. 313. <hi>de for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mula Concordia.</hi> Their words are theſe: VVee teach with the Apoſtle that God in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of the reprobates will declare his iuſtice, and therefore hath not allotted any to condemnation but for ſinne, and doth not will damnation, as it is damnation, but as it is a moſt iuſt puniſhment. And puniſhment hath no place, but where ſinne goes before. But in the Elect he would declare his mercie, becauſe when he might very iuſtly caſt away all mankinde, for the ſinne whereinto they were falne, (for all of vs were the children of wrath as well as other) of his onely meere mercie, he determined to take ſome out of the common deſtruction, that euery mouth might be ſtopped, and all the glorie be giuen to God.</p>
               <p>The very ſame doth Luther, Calvin, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Beza, Bucer, and other excellent Diuines teach.</p>
               <p>Although God decreed to reprobate, and condemne, &amp; puniſh for ſinne thoſe that were reprobated, yet is not ſinne the cauſe of the decree. And that I prooue by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> If Eſaus reprobation was decreed, before he was borne and had done either good or ill, then ſinne is not the efficient cauſe of the decree of reprobation: but the firſt is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19839:72"/>true: <hi>ergo.</hi> Rom. 9.11. prooues the firſt. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing both Iacobs good works and Eſaus ill from beeing the efficient cauſe of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Obiect.</hi> The aduerſaries obiect, that this place is not ſo much to be vnderſtood of Iacob and Eſau, as of the people that were borne of them, which they prooue becauſe the places of Moſes and Malachie that are alleadged talke of the people of Iſrael and Idumea, or the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of Iacob and Eſau.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They cauill of ſet purpoſe. For they doe not anſwer the place of Paul, which I brought to confirme mine argument, namely, <hi>when the children were yet vnborne, and before they had done either good or ill.</hi> Let them ſay that the Apoſtle remooues not away both Eſaus ill works and Iacobs good ones. Here is the pith of mine argument, let them hamſtring this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new if they can or dare. 2. They paſſe by this argument with ſilence, and obiect againſt the two teſtimonies alleadged by Paul, as if the argument of proofe had beene fetched from them, and ſo gaineſay Pauls words, who moſt certenly ſpeakes of Iacobs and Eſaus perſons. verſ. 10. <hi>Neither did he onely</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca alſo, when ſhee had conceiued by one, namely our father Iſaac, had experience of the ſame.</hi> I pray of whome did ſhee goe then, not of Eſau and Iacob? the ſame is cleare by verſ. 11. <hi>for before the children were yet borne, or euer they had done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or ill.</hi> Of what children doth he ſpeak?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19839:72"/>of Eſau and Iacob. 3. They refute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wherein they ſaide, that Paul ſpeakes not ſo much of Eſau, as of his poſteritie, when they ſay when Eſau was a type of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Iewes. If Eſau was here brought in as a type of the reiected nation of the Iewes, what neede they in Eſaus name, vnderſtand Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means or poſteritie of Eſau? Againe, he that takes the words of the Prophet, Malach. 1.2, 3. to be vnderſtood of their poſteritie, and not of Eſaus and Iacobs owne perſons, doe iniurie to the text.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Obiect.</hi> This place of Paul may not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of eternall election or reprobation, becauſe elſe it ſhould neceſſarily follow, that not onely Iacob was abſolutely predeſtinated to eternall ſaluation, but alſo the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that deſcended of him. And againe, that not onely Eſau was ſimply reiected from the grace of God, but that all his poſteritie every one was ſimply reprobates. For the teſtimonies which Paul brings to prooue his purpoſe, ſpeake of the people that iſſued from theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>But theſe conſequences were abſurd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Iacobs poſteritie were not ſaued, nor yet all Eſaus condemned. Therefore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is falſe that this place of Pauls is not to be vnderſtood of eternall election or reprobation. For he ſpeakes ſo plainely that none that is well in his wittes can denie it. <hi>When the children were yet vnborne, &amp;c. that the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19839:73"/>purpoſe of God which is according to Election, not of workes, but of him that calleth, ſhould ſtand ſure.</hi> Now graunting there is Election, we muſt needes allo graunt Reprobation, becauſe there is no election without reprobation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth not follow: for thoſe abſurdities doe not enſue by graunting our opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe v. 11. out of which the argument of our reaſon is fetch, ſpeaks of their perſons and not of their poſteritie, but they deale not with vs as if we diſputed out of Moſes, Gen. 25. and Malach. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the application of our authorities, v. 12. &amp; 13. they accuſe not vs but Paul, as if he had wrongly drawne it vnto their perſons, which the ſeat it ſelfe (as they fondly ſpeake) doth ſhew it ſhould be referred to the people which came of them. As if they were better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Moſes and Malachie then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Paul, and that which he applieth to their perſons, did not indeede belong to them, but to both poſtetities.</p>
               <p>But to the ende that Pauls applying of it may be tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>owly vnderſtood, we muſt obſerue 3. axiomes very behoouefull for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. Corporall and temporatie matters promiſed vnto the fathers in the old teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, were types and ſacraments of greater matters, euen of ſpirituall and eternall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The things that God ioyned wich his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, no man may plucke aſunder, but he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19839:73"/>ioyned ſpirituall and eternall thinges with corporall and temporall: <hi>ergo</hi> not to bee ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Pauls vſe is to compriſe the queſtion or the ſentence to bee confirmed and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof both together in the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie he alleadgeth, ſo that omitting the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to be confirmed, he ſets downe the teſtimonie onely, becauſe there in the ſentence to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed is contained alſo. Now I will annex the reaſon of Pauls application; becauſe that the chiefe or greater part of the Iewes being puft vpp with the title of the church ſet at naught the goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, the faith of many ſimple men beganne to faint, who among the gentiles had imbraced the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: becauſe they thought it not likelie that Ieſus Chriſt and the ſaluation in him promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed could poſſiblie bee reiected of the elected people, the holy nation and naturall Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. Therefore Paule to arme the weaker ſort againſt this ſcandall, giues them to witt: that none of the beleeuers ought to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that all the Iſraelites did not imbrace the goſpell and beleeue in Chriſt Ieſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were reiected: which reiection on ſome good reaſon hee ſets downe very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely. Romaines 9.1.2.3. then ver. 6. there is an occupation, wherein hee meets with this obiection. <hi>Jf the nation of the Jevves bee reiected, then the vvorde of God is fallen to the grounde:</hi> that is, his promiſe that hee made
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19839:74"/>to Abraham is made voide, whereby he adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his poſteritie into a people to himſelfe. Paul denies the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, and ſaies the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is not annihilated, <hi>becauſe all are not Iſrael that are of the father Iſrael. that are of the father Iſrael.</hi> We muſt vnderſtand there are two houſes of Iacob, one of fleſh and blood the other borne of the ſpirit and faith ſaith Iuſtine Martyr in his dialogue with <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi> the Iew. Now the promiſe belongs to the ſonnes that were borne of the ſpirite and faith, and not to the ſonnes of the fleſh: and this hee proueth by two like examples.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is of Abrahams children, of whom Iſaac was onely counted for his ſonne: and leſt any man ſhould ſurmiſe, that this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſtretched no further then Iſaac and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael onely, the Apoſtle ſets downe the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall application. <hi>Thoſe are not the children of God that are the children of the fleſh, but they that are the children of the promiſe are accounted in the ſeede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond example is of Eſau and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: who albeit they were borne of Iſaac the ſonne of the promiſe, both of one mother and at one birth, not at diuers as Iſmael and Iſaac were, yet onely Iacob was choſen and Eſau was reiected. The time of the reiection is deſcribed in theſe words: <hi>when the children were yet vnborn:</hi> that is before ſhee was deliuered: then their works are denied to bee the efficient cauſe of Iacobs election and Eſaus reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in theſe words <hi>when they had done neither good nor ill: ergo:</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:19839:74"/>good works were not the cauſe of chooſing Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, norill works the cauſe of caſting of Eſau. And thus doth Auguſtine expound this place tom. 7. in his booke of the predeſtination of the Saints cap. 16. <hi>But we come back to little ones, to twins, to them (if that be two little) that were yet vnborne: who were begot both at one time, and to bee borne both at one inſtant. The diuers and diſcrepant iudgement of Gods will appears in them: vvhere the deepnes of the queſtion vvill trouble the ſence of men, that argue to proudly of the vvill of God. Exalt thy voice vvith all thy power now thou vniuſt accuſer of the iuſt, and tell me what harme he did, what good the other: and Paul ſhall anſwer thee not I, neither of them had deſerued any thing, but the potter hath power ouer the clay, to make of the ſame lump, one veſſel to honor, another to diſhonor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is ſet downe the end why their works muſt not bee accounted the cauſe of election and reprobation, <hi>(viz.) that the purpoſe of God which is according to election, not of works but of him that calleth, ſhould remaine firme.</hi> After that Eſaus reiection is hereby proued, for that albeit hee were the elder brother, yet he was giuen to be his brothers ſeruant, according to the diuine oracle extant Gen. 25.23. But as Pauls ſtile is conciſe and briefe, the ſentence concerning the difference betweene Iacob and Eſau is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the teſtimonie that he citeth out of Geneſis: <hi>when they were yet vnborne &amp;c.</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid: the elder was reiected &amp; the younger elected, as it was ſaid to Rebecca. <hi>The
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19839:75"/>elder ſhall ſerue the younger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But this application of this oracle may ſeeme vnſeaſonable for two cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that ſpeaks of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereas Paul deals but of Eſau and Iacob onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſpeakes but of corporall ſeruitude or Lordſhip, but Paul of their ſpirituall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Anſ.</hi> For the firſt, wee are to learne that the oracle ſpeaks ſo of two peoples as not excluding their beginners: nay comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth-them in their authors. For to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the two nations themſelues were not in Rebeccaes wombe, but onely their authors: therefore that which the oracle ſpake of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Paul did rightly applye to their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: becauſe the triall and truth ought to bee exhibited in the authors and heads of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelues. Therefore Iſaac-ſaies to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau Gen. 27.39. <hi>Behold I haue made him thy Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the ſecond, the truth is, the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſoundes of the externall prerogatiue of the birthright and poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan, tranſlated vnto Iacob and of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ſeruitude wherein the poſteritie of Eſau was ſubiect to the poſteritie of Iacob, but it doth not exclude ſpirituall and internall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>For the tranſlation of the birthright and title of poſſeſſing the land of Canaan vnto Iacob, and Iacobs dominion ouer Eſau, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:19839:75"/>Eſaus ſeruitude, was a tipe of a greater thing, namely of Iacobs ſpirituall election, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaus reprobation: that is, that Iacob was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, both to bee the heire of eternall life, as alſo to bee the enlarger of the church, ſo that his poſteritie poſſeſſed the name and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the church and enioyed the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of the couenant of grace. And on the other ſide that Eſau was reiected, both from the inheritance of eternall life, and alſo from the ſocietie of the church: and therefore that his offſpring the Idumeans ſhould bee cut from the body of the church. So doeth Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine expound this place of election or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination to honor. <hi>lib. de praedeſt. &amp; gra. cap.</hi> 9. ſaying, that the bleſſed Apoſtle, ſpeaking a little aboue of the iudgement of Gods power in mens election, confirmed it with impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples, where hee ſpake of Rebeccaes child bearing and iſſue yet within her bellie, referring the whole matter to Gods grace: and he concludes the chapter thus, he ſaieth not of workes before going, but when hee ſaide generally <hi>not of vvorkes,</hi> there he would haue vs vnderſtand both paſt and to come: paſt which were not at all; to come, which were not yet. Iacob was predeſtinated a veſſell to honor, <hi>becauſe not of vvorkes, but of him that calleth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19839:76"/>
                  <hi>the elder &amp;c.</hi> hee concludes, that Iacob was predeſtinated a veſſel vnto honor. The like he doth <hi>de praedeſt. ſanct. cap.</hi> 16. and again in his booke <hi>de correp. &amp; gra. cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> If that oracle muſt bee vnderſtood of election and reprobation, then all Iacobs poſteritie were elected and all Eſaus reiected: but they were out: <hi>ergo:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The connex is vntrue, for it followes not, if Iacob be elected vnto life, that al his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity muſt needs be ſo: becauſe election doth not depend vpon the carnall generation of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, but of the freewil of god electing whome he will: likewiſe againe it is not neceſſary that al Eſaus ſonnes ſhould be reprobates, becauſe of the ſame reaſon: for that reprobation doth not depend vpon the carnall generation, but of the iuſt will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But neither Rebecca not Eſau vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that oracle <hi>(the elder ſhall ſerue the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)</hi> of Eſaus eternall reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no more muſt we: and much leſſe, that he was by Gods moſt abſolute will and decree neuer more to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, adiudged to the puniſhment of hel fire eternally: and this is good for two reaſons. 1. becauſe if Iſaac and Rebecca, by the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods ſpirit, had thought the oracle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the children yet vnborne muſt bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, how could it poſſiblie be, that they ſhould not be vtterly ſwallowed vpp and kild vp with ſuch vnſpeakable griefe, if they had
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19839:76"/>though that there little babie dandled on his mothers lapp, and ſucking at her breſt had bin by force of the oracle a firebrand of hell, in ſo much as that all meanes of grace and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had beene barred vpp againſt him moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, and that for no other cauſe in the worlde, but becauſe God would haue it ſo? and <hi>ergo</hi> the mother vnderſtood it not thus.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Iſaac, or rather the verie ſpirit of God, profeſſedly expounding the oracle Gen. 27. did not vnderſtand it of eternall reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They deale ſophiſtically by many captious interrogations as if they were al one: for in this conſequent there are two queſtions put for one. The firſt of which onely pertaines to the controuerſie now in hand: the ſecond is nothing to the purpoſe &amp; detractory: becauſe by the ſimple will and vnchangeable decree of God, whereby Eſau is adiudged to hell fire, they vnderſtand according to their manner, <hi>to be ordained to damnation without reſpect of ſinne:</hi> but we hold that god hath adiudged none to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but onely for ſinne: therefore auaunt with this ſlaunder.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The propoſition that is leſt out doth not follow, if Rebecca and Iſaac did not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the oracle ſo, then we muſt not: for all things were not ſo plainely deliuered to the faithfull in the old reſtament, as they are in the new: <hi>ergo</hi> though Iſaac and Rebecca did not fully knowe the meaning of it, yet Paul did, whome we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

               <p n="3">3. But Rebecca and Iſaac did vnderſtand it ſo, as for the proofes they proue it not. For the firſt is but a meere and idle floriſh of rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, and an exaggeration of the ſorrowe which Iſaac and Rebecca ſhould haue taken if they had vnderſtood the oracle of eternall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and ſuch as would greatly moue pitie in ſeelie women, that can eaſily ſhedd teares very te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derly for any thing, but not ſuch as truely beleeue, and reuerently ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the will of God; as Iſaac and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca did, without grudging or reſiſting gods will. What? did not Abraham vnderſtand that Iſmael was excluded from the earthly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and therewithall from the inheritance of eternall life? and yet he died not for griefe: Did not Dauid knowe that Abſolom was the childe of hel, and yet was neuer ſwallowed vp with ſorrow for the matter? wee muſt not bee more mercifull then God, but with reuerence approue his good will, though it ſeeme ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard to fleſh &amp; blood. The ſecond proofe beggs the queſtion, as if Iſaac when he bleſſed Iacob, had his minde ſetled vpon corporal and temporall matters onely, and had not rather his eye vpon ſpirituall and eternal, as we col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Heb. 11.20. Where the Apoſtle bringeth the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Iſaac, by faith bleſſing his ſonnes of future matters; thereby to proue the nature of ſauing faith which is not fixed vpon earthly
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:19839:77"/>but heauenly things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Yet Eſau in Paul is brought in not for an example of eternall reprobation, but for a type of the reprobate people of the Iewes: arguing thus, he that was a type, &amp;c. is not an example of reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The propoſition is falſe, and ſuch an other as this; He that was a type of Iudas the betraier as Doeg was, is not an example of betraying. Doeg both was a type and the man himſelfe: and ſo was Eſau. 2. They di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>prooue their aſſumption themſelues, ſaying the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Eſau is not ſo much meant in this place, as the people that ſprong of him. For if the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domices be here meant by Eſau, how then is Eſau here put for a type of the reiected Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites? if they ſay the Edomites are alſo by him vnderſtood, this anſwer is not worth a ruſh. For if by Eſau all his poſteritie be vnderſtood that were ingaged to be ſlaues to Iacob and his poſteritie, and reiected from the lande of Canaan, it will follow that all were ſeruants: which is falſe. For Eſaus poſteritie was firſt of all ſubdued by Dauid and brought into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, 2. Sam. 8.13. whereas beforetime they had bin free, and their kings no others vaſſals. Neither did they euer ſerue, becauſe the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites ſhooke off the yoke of bondage and ſeruitude vnder Ioram the ſonne of Ioſaphat, 2. King. 8.20. as Iſaac prophecied, Gen. 27.40. yea and that which is more then ſo, Herod the Edumean and his poſteritie
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19839:78"/>ruled and raigned afterward in the lande of Ganaan. 3. If the aſſumption were true, that is, that Eſau was a type of the people of the Iewes that was ſo to be reiected, then can it not be denied but that Eſau himſelfe was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</p>
               <p>They prooue their obiection thus: Iſmael alſo was caſt out of his fathers houſe, and in him there was a type ſhadowing out that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie that the people of the Iewes ſhould one day be reiected: but who would hereupon inferre, that Iſmael was reiected by euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting reprobation from ſaluation? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Marrie that doth Paul, Galat. 4.30. <hi>What ſaies the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? caſt out the bondman and her ſonne, for the ſonne of the bondwoman ſhall not be heire with the ſonne of the free:</hi> but the barring from the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritance, was a ſigne &amp; token of barring from the heauenly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Obiect.</hi> That by this place of Paul we are not to gather Eſaus eternall reprobation, is cleare by the very manner of applying this type of Iacob and Eſau to his purpoſe. For thus hee would ſay. Euen as the title of the birthright and the promiſe of poſſeſſing the land, did not depend vpon workes, as it did not vpon this carnall priuiledge, that Eſau was elder then Iacob, but vpon free election, by which, not of workes (which the children yet vnborne could haue none of, neither good nor badde,) but of him that called it was ſaid, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerue the younger.</hi> So againe in
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19839:78"/>the type, (the inheritance of eternall life) we muſt not thinke is theirs, that ſtand vpon their carnall generation and natiuitie of Abraham, Iſaac, and Iacob, or ſeeke ſaluation in their workes: but the inheritance is theirs, who neither vaunt of their workes, nor bragge of their carnall prerogatiue from Abraham, but put their whole truſt and affiance of their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and ſaluation in the free mercie of God. This is Pauls onely drift in this place, and not any other thing contrarie hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This inſtance is falſe, fooliſh, and hangs not together. Falſe, firſt becauſe Paul doth not in this manner applie thoſe things he ſpake of Eſau and Iacob, to his purpoſe, but the cleane contrarie way. For this is Pauls propoſition in the 6. verſe, <hi>Not all that are of the father Iſrael, are Iſrael:</hi> that is, not all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue their pedigree from Iſrael, are to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the true Iſraelites, or all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie of the Patriarke Iacob, are in truth the ſonnes of Iacob. This the Apoſtle prooueth by two very like examples: firſt, becauſe all the ſonnes of Abraham, are truly ſonnes: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not all the ſonnes of Iſaac and Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, are ſonnes in deede. And thus doth the Apoſtle applie them. As all the ſonnes of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac and Rebecca are not truly ſonnes, ſo not all that are of the father Iſrael, are true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, or truly the ſonnes of Iſrael. That all the ſonnes of Iſaac and Rebecca are truly ſonnes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:19839:79"/>he prooueth by the adiuncts, becauſe one of them, that is, Iacob was elect, the other, to wit, Eſau, was reiected. And ſhewes that the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating of the birthright vpon Iacob, was the teſtimonie of his election, as alſo his Lordſhip ouer Eſau, and the taking away of the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right from Eſau, and giuing him to be a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetuant vnto Iacob, was a ſigne of Eſaus reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And the cauſe of Gods diſpoſing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after this order, by which meanes Eſau was reiected and Iacob elected, he ſaith was not their workes, either good or ill. 2. It is falſe for ſo conſitruing the priuiledge of the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, as if there were nothing elſe meant thereby, but onely the inriching Iacob with earthly bleſſings, and depriuing of Eſau of temporall commodities, without any reſpect had vnto the heauenly. And ſo that Iacobs faith was fixed but onely vpon temporall things, which is very abſurd.</p>
               <p n="2">2 It cannot ſtand. For it ſaies that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of poſſeſſing the land did not depend on workes, as neither on this carnall priuiledge that Eſau was the elder brother; ſeeing that promiſe was made to Iacob, how can the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing away of Iacobs works &amp; Eſaus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of the fleſh ſtand both together? ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould haue ſaid thus, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of poſſeſſing the land, did not depend on Iacobs good works, nor yet was hindred by Eſaus carnall priuiledge, becauſe Eſau was the elder. And not that it did not depend theron.</p>

For he wills not nor approoues of ſinne, but is highly diſpleaſed with it, nor is delighted with any mans, no not the very deuills perdition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="2">2 <hi>Obiect.</hi> God preaching the ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Ezek. 18. addes this moreouer, <hi>why ſhould ye die ye houſe of Iſrael, becauſe I vvill not the death of him that dies, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Therefore God abſolutely wills not any way the death of thoſe that die or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Againe he chaungeth the ſtate of the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19839:89"/>queſtion: for we deny not that it is truely ſaid, that God doth not abſolutely will the death of thoſe that die and periſh: but ſay with the Apoſtle, that <hi>death is the ſtipend of ſinne.</hi> Rom. 6.23. and with the Prophet, <hi>that ſoule vvhich ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſhall die.</hi> Ezech. 18.4. neither denie we that it is truely ſaid, <hi>that God will not the death of him that dieth,</hi> that is, that he delighteth not in it, but this we denie, that it is truely ſaid that the will of God is not the cauſe of the eternall decree of reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 3. God ſpeaks not in the foreſaid place of the temporall death onely, but of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Neither doe we vnderſtand it of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death onely, but of eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4. If it be contrary to Gods nature &amp; will for any to die a temporall death, much more it is repugnant inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably to his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull will for one to be tormented with euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and endles paines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Again the ſtate of the queſtion is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: for we ſay not that God in his bountifull will, will haue any puniſhed euerlaſtingly, but this, that God iuſtly will that the reprobate be endleſly tormented. For this is the queſtion: <hi>whether the vvill of God bee the cauſe of the eternall decree of reprobation:</hi> we ſay it is. 2. The ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codent is doubtful, and may be taken 2 waies, either that God is not delighted ſo much as with ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral death: or that God wil by no meanes the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral death: in the firſt ſenſe wee
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:19839:90"/>graunt it, but that is no queſtion: in the ſecond we deny it: for if by no means he would it, none ſhould die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> 4. If an earthly father cannot abide that his ſonne ſhould cruelly be whipped and ſcourged, and it would euen gripe him to the heart to ſee him put to death? much more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may we ſay it of God, if he doth a ſtraunge work by afflicting men with temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts as he calleth it Eſ. 28. much more ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge a work is it to deliuer him vp to be puniſhed in hell euerlaſtingly. Therefore this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtands faſt and firme inough: yet that God by his ſimple and abſolute hate without reſpect of impenitencie will not by any will, the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or damnation of any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The ſtate of the queſtion is chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againe, becauſe this opinion ſtands ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and firme to vs alſo, that God by his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and abſolute hate without reſpect of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitencie wil not by any will the deſtruction or damnation of any.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt part of the compariſon is but particular: for I could giue ſome inſtances that ſhould infringe it: for example T. Manlius Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his ſonne ſhould be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to death. Iunius Brutus ſate iudge himſelfe to condemne his ſonnes going about ſome treacherie, and when they were beheadded looked on; a memorable example of iuſtice. Turius a wealthy man baniſhed his ſonne and was commended for it through all Rome: as

               <p n="3">3. The reddition of the compariſon is faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for two cauſes. 1. ambiguous in calling the inflicting of puniſhment and ſending affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Gods ſtraunge work: as if it were not gods owne work to be the iudge of the world, and ſhew examples in the wicked of his iuſtice. Eſ. 38.21. That is called Gods ſtraunge work and vncouth, that is rare and vnvſuall, infre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and very admirable: namely when he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the Philiſtines and threatned to do the ſame to the Iewes ere they wiſt, without any mans art: therefore it is ſo called ſtraunge that yet it is ſaid to be Gods. Gods work to come vpon them ſodenly from heauen as he ſerued the Philiſtines 2. Sam. 5.24. 1. Cr. 14.15. yet a ſtraunge work, becauſe it was rare, ſtrange &amp; admirable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Falſe, becauſe it auoucheth that it is a work farre from Gods nature, to deliuer a man vp euerlaſtingly to bee tormenred in hell fire: when as God ſaith. Deut. 32.35. <hi>Reuenge and retribution is mine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Rom. 11.32. <hi>God hath concluded all vnder vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe that he might haue mercie on all:</hi> therefore none of thoſe that are ſhutt vnder vnbeliefe, is abſolutely reprobate from the mercie of God, but Gods ſauing mercie is offred vnto all indifferently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The queſtion is altered, for this ſhould haue bin inferred: <hi>Ergo:</hi> the will of God is not the cauſe of the decree of reprobation. 2. Againe they deceiue vs by a captious plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of interrogatories, as if they were but one. The firſt whereof is falſe, the ſecond true: for wee graunt that Gods ſauing is offred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to all: but wee denie that none of thoſe that are ſhutt vpp vnder contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or diſobedience (for ſo the greeke doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beare) is abſolutely reiected, without the condition of their future naughtie works, as impelling cauſes; for we euicted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie before. 3. This falſe conſectarie is but euen ilfauouredly pickt out of Pauls words. For therein the generall particle of the elect both Iewes and Gentiles is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for of them the Apoſtle ſpake, which alſo the article ſet before the generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle doeth declare <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>God concluded thoſe:</hi> euery one in contumacie, that hee might haue mercie on them euerie one. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19839:91"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this, all that are ſaued of the Iewes or Gentiles, are not ſaued any other way but by the mercie of God, whereas all of them are concluded vnder contumacie and in themſelues are guiltie of eternall death. And therefore the Gentiles had no cauſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of the Iewes, for whatſoeuer they were nowe they had beene as all other: and if by Gods meere mercie they had eſcaped out of vnbeliefe and rebellion, they ſhould giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men leaue to haue the like fauour. In a word the Apoſtle ſhewes that God hath ſo ordered matters by his owne prouidence, that all ſhould bee guiltie of rebellion and diſobedience and vnder the iudgement of God, and that for this purpoſe, that ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould proceede from his meere mercie. Therefore they aree freelie ſaued whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are ſaued, becauſe all are loſt indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> If this place is ment of the elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it followes the elect onely are ſhutt vpp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſobedience, &amp; not the reprobate: which is abſurd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The connex is deceitfull becauſe doubtfull: for the place is not to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the elect onely, as if they onely were ſhutt vnder diſobedience, but becauſe they of whome God hath mercie to ſaue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none but the elect, are all ſhutt vpp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſobedience, as well as the reprobate. This then is the Apoſtles meaning, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:19839:92"/>none of the elect, or ſuch as ſhould bee ſaued, ſhould attribute their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto their works, but altogether vnto Gods mercie. 1. Tim. 2.4. <hi>God vvould that all men ſhould bee ſaued and come to the knovvledge of the trueth: Ergo:</hi> his will is not the cauſe of the decree of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here is a ſophiſme, making them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites which are not: for the word <hi>vvill</hi> in the latter part of the enthymeme, ſignifies Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall counſell, which he hath propounded with himſelfe from euerlaſting: but in the firſt part, of Pauls words, his precept, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, incitation vnto ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth: as that, <hi>Come vnto me all you that are wearie and laden.</hi> Mat. 11.28. <hi>Looke vnto me and yee ſhalbe ſaued all the ends of the earth.</hi> Eſ. 45.22. <hi>with feare and trembling vvorke your ovvne ſaluation.</hi> Phil. 2.12. And indeed the whole prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the goſpell is the inuiting of all men to ſaluation and the knowledge of the trueth: as Paul ſpeaks Act. 17.30. <hi>The time of this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance God regarded not, but now hee admoniſheth all men euerie where to repent.</hi> That this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the word <hi>will</hi> in the Apoſtles ſpeach, the text will manifeſt: for by what meanes hee would haue men come to the knowledge of the trueth, by the ſame hee would haue all men ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for he compriſeth both theſe vnder the ſame will. But God would haue all men come to the knowledge of the trueth, by bidding, inuiting, commaunding, and euen praying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:19839:92"/>to come: therefore he would haue them ſaued by bidding, &amp;c. as is cleare by the teſtimonies aboue alleadged: whereto we add this. 2. Cor. 5.20. <hi>We are Embaſſadors in Chriſts name, and as if God did beſeech you by vs, vvee praye you in Chriſts ſteed be reconciled to God.</hi> But it cannot be ment of Gods eternall councell: for if it were his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall decree that all ſhould be ſaued, ſurely all ſhould be ſaued. <hi>For the councell of God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth for euer, and the thoughts of his heart euery age.</hi> Pſal. 34.11. <hi>The Lord of boaſts hath purpoſed and who ſhall fruſtrate him.</hi> Eſ. 14.27. <hi>My counſell ſhall ſtand and I will work all my pleaſure.</hi> Eſ. 46.10.

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. He that hath mercie on all, &amp; loueth all things that are, and hateth nothing of that he hath made, doubtles his will is not the cauſe &amp;c. but thoſe things are true of God: <hi>ergo:</hi> Wiſ. 11.24. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is an homonymie in the words <hi>to haue mercie, to loue, to hate:</hi> For in the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:19839:93"/>is ment a ſpeciall loue and mercie, by which God as a moſt free Lord hath mercie on whome he will Rom. 9.18. and an eſpecial loue which peculiarly he extendeth to his elect, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching them with all the benefites thereof, in which ſort he loued Iacob Mat. 1.2. Ro. 9.13. and a ſpeciall hate by which God (hauing cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to ſaluation whome he would) paſſed ouer whome he would, ſuch as hee vſed toward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau Mat. 1.3. Rom. 9.13.</p>
               <p>But in the aſſumption and place out of the booke of wiſedome, gods generall mercie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all creatures that are in any miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and therein to al men aſwell vniuſt as iuſt, wherein he is prone to ſuccour them and doth indeed preſeruing and nouriſhing all things, euen the eury rauens that <hi>crie</hi> Pſal. 147.9. that is that <hi>croke.</hi>

               <p>The old tranſlation hath <hi>that call on him,</hi> but it is not ſo in the hebrew: that is his owne. So likewiſe his generall loue &amp;c, ſo God hates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that he hath made ſo farre forth as he made it, 2. If the words be hardly vrged and vnderſtood of the ſpeciall mercie, loue, &amp; hate, it will follow, that no man at all is reiected of God, no not for ſinne, which I thinke they will not ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argu.</hi> 6. He that will gather all, his will is not the cauſe of reprobation: God would ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Mat. 23.37. <hi>How often vvould J haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thy children &amp;c. ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Vnder the name <hi>will,</hi> in the ſubiect
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19839:93"/>is meant a deſire and earneſt labour, but in the predicate Gods counſell and purpoſe. 2. But be it ſo, that the counſell of God ſhould be meant in the ſubiect of the propoſition, yet there ſhould be ſtill a fallacie of <hi>homonymie</hi> in the obiection, becauſe in the aſſumption by <hi>will</hi> is meant deſire and earneſt labour. 3. They offend in proouing the aſſumption, by allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an impertinent teſtimonie; becauſe the aſſumption ſpeakes of the will of God, but the ſaying that is brought out of Matthew is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the humane will of Chriſt. For Chriſt ſpeakes of himſelfe as he is man, namely as he is the miniſter of circumciſion, or a Prophet ſent to the people of the Iewes, which Chriſt by his humane will deſired and ſought to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together euery one that was offered vnto him, into the kingdome of God by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Here they vrge: 1. if Chriſts humane will be here meant, then was that contrarie to his will as he was God, which is the cauſe of the dectee of the reprobation of the Iewes. 2. The diuine will is rather to be vnderſtood, by which he would gather the Iewes by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which he ſent vnto them, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually riſing earely and ſending them as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temie ſpeaketh, Ier. 7.13: 11.7. and 35.15.</p>
               <p>Concerning the former part of this their exception, 1. there is an elench of <hi>non conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> For how could Chriſts humane will be contrarie to the diuine will, ſeeing it wholly
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19839:94"/>reſted in the eternall good pleaſure of God, as appeares by Math. 11.25, 26.2. If the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent were true, God alſo might be thought contrarie to himſelfe: for he would, that is, he deſireth that all men ſhould be ſaued, and yet he doth indurate whome he will. Now as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſecond part of this exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though we ſhould graunt that the diuine will of Chriſt be meant, yet it followes not thereupon that his will is not the cauſe of the decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation: for the <hi>homonymie</hi> remaines ſtill. For Chriſt would ſo gather together the Iewes, namely by inuiting them to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that they ſhould repent and beleeue the Goſpel, and ſo would the decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation by his eternall counſell and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 They vrge againe. If Chriſt would haue the gathering together of the Iewes, and yet withall willed the decree of reprobation, then was he a diſſembler, and had contrarie wills. But this is abſurd. Therefore that. <hi>Anſ.</hi> I denie the conſequence. For he was no diſſembler, for he willed in earneſt and not diſſemblingly, but they would not: neither had he contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie wills. For in a contradiction the tearmes muſt be the ſame in both places, and take all one way. But when it is ſaid, <hi>God would the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together of the Iewes, and God would the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall decree of their reprobation,</hi> there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction at all. Firſt, becauſe the ſame predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate is not in both places: ſecondly, <hi>will</hi> is not
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19839:94"/>all one in both ſubiects. In the firſt it ſignifies to deſire, in the latter euerlaſtingly to decree. Indeede thus it were a contradictorie, God did deſire to gather the Iewes. God did not deſire to gather the Iewes. Gods counſell is the cauſe of the decree. Gods counſell is not the cauſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They replie and ſay; yes two wills are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to God, if he will all ſhould repent, and yet wills eternally the reprobation of many, that doe not repent. I <hi>anſwer</hi> there is an homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymie in the word <hi>will.</hi> For God would haue all repent [by his commandement:] but yet would the reprobation of many by his counſel and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Then his commaundement croſſes his eternall counſell. <hi>Anſ.</hi> No: becauſe in that he declares what he likes and ſeekes hartily for, in all men, but not what he will doe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one: but by this he caſts what he will doe in euery one. Therefore God willing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding repentance, ſhewes he is pleaſed in all that repent, but willing the decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, he determines to reiect thoſe that doe not.</p>
               <p n="7">7 He that promiſeth ſaluation to all, his will is not the cauſe of reprobation. God doth promiſe ſo: <hi>ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> He that promiſeth ſaluation to all, (ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie without any condition of faith.) 2. God promiſeth ſaluation, but not ſimply but with this condition, if they beleeue, if they lay hold
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19839:95"/>on ſaluation by faith. For the vniuerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace belongs indeede to all, but yet to all that beleeue onely; becauſe promiſe and faith are relatiues one to an other. Now then he is ſimple, to vnderſtand that ſimply that is ſpoken but in reſpect.</p>
               <p n="8">8 He that offers ſaluation to all, his will is not the cauſe of the decree of reprobation. God offereth to all. <hi>Anſ.</hi> He that offers it without commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of taking it by faith, but ſo doth not God.

               <p n="9">9 If there be any abſolute reprobation, that is, if Gods will be the ſole cauſe of the decree of reprobation, the reprobates cannot chooſe but ſinne: but that is falſe: <hi>ergo.</hi>

For it is not abſurd to ſay that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates cannot chooſe but ſinne, who lie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in wickednes. Though no man ſinnes againſt his will, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaies, <hi>lib. de bap.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> If they cannot but ſinne, then they deſerue to be excuſed. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Nere a whit. Nay they deſerue to be puniſhed ſo much the more, becauſe by how much the more neceſſarily they ſinne, by ſo much the more voluntarily they doe it, ſeeing their will hath brought them this neceſſitie, and they reſiſt and iniurie God wittingly and willingly. Therefore they cannot excuſe themſelues by pretending ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.</p>
               <p n="10">10 If Gods pleaſure onely be the cauſe of the decree of reprobation, then God is a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and vniuſt iudge, that for no cauſe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with them that neuer offend him: but not ſo. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The connex is falſe, becauſe it is pluckt in by head and ſhoulders of that ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. But if Gods pleaſure be the ſole cauſe indeede of the decree of reprobation, then it follows onely that God hath higheſt rule and free power, to doe with his owne what he liſt. Which right and power whoſoeuer depriues God of, denies him, or at leaſt preferres him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before him. Seeing euery one would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of his owne how he liſt, may not a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his meere good will exact his debt of one and pardon another? may not a prince take one into his houſe to ſerue him and let paſſe many other? now ſhould that prince
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19839:96"/>or creditour be vniuſt for ſo doing? no. Then if a man be not vniuſt for dealing according to his owne minde, ſhall God whoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is moſt iuſt? ſo then there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene a tyrant that deales in all things as he liſt, and God that worketh all things according to the counſell of his owne will. For their liſt is vniuſt and ruled by no law, but Gods will is the rule of all iuſtice, ſo that whatſoeuer he wills is iuſt and equall. Neither frame we a God that is law leſſe, but he is a law to himſelfe. Men neede lawes, that are ſubiect to lewde deſires, but Gods will is not onely pure from all vice, but the chiefeſt rule of all perfection, and the law of <hi>all</hi> lawes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The proofe of the connex is falſe: ariſing of a falſe definition of the decree of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely to be Gods wrath. But the decree of reprobation, is his eternall will, (not his wrath,) paſſing ouer ſome in electing whome he thought not good to take. Gods wrath is ſtirred vp by ſinne, ſo is not his decree of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: other wiſe God were a tyrant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, beeing angrie for nothing with them that neuer grieued him.</p>
               <p n="11">11 If Gods meere will be the cauſe, then God doth with crueltie abuſe his creatures: but that is blaſphemous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followes not. For God reiecting whome he will, doth not abuſe, but vſe moſt holily and iuſtly the reprobate to declare in them his great power and freedome, ſo that

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19839:97"/>to that, which himſelfe had decreed both to forbid by expreſſe commaundement, and in mercie to blotte out and in iuſtice to puniſh.

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But Chriſt was deliuered vp by Iudas the betraier by Gods determinate counſell, Act. 20.23. and, 4.27. Therefore the reprobate are predeſtinate of God to ſinne.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Obiect.</hi> Saluation of the elect is the ende of election, therefore deſtruction of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate is the end of reprobation. <hi>Anſ.</hi> It follows not, for there is not the ſame reaſon.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19839:97"/>findeth none capable of ſaluation, but choſeth them vnto it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Obiect.</hi> God createth the wicked to the day of euill. Prov. 16.4. <hi>Ergo:</hi> deſtruction is the ende of reprobation.</p>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The meaning of Salomon is this, God creates not wickednes, but the wicked men: for after the fall he maketh man of that lump, that he came vnto by his fall: that is, corrupt, which thing the <hi>harmonie</hi> doth acknowledge in the point of originall ſinne <hi>fol.</hi> 261. of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſet out in Germanie 1580.

               <p n="3">3. But the end of reprobation is <hi>both Gods glory and the ſaluation of the elect.</hi> It ſerues the glory of God two waies. 1. it maketh to the declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his free power and abſolute right, to do with his owne creatures what he pleaſe. For God ſaith to Pharao, <hi>For this very ende haue I ſtirred thee vp to ſhew my povver in thee, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my name throughout the whole earth.</hi> Rom. 9.17. <hi>Therefore willing to ſhew his wrath and make his power knowne, be beareth vvith great gentlenes the veſſels of wrath</hi> Rom. 9.22. If earthly princes haue that authoritie, God much more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It maketh to the commendation of his mercie to the elect: that is, God hath reiected ſome, to make knowne his great loue to vs: for his benefite which hee freelie beſtoweth on ſome would not bee ſeene, but by paſſing by
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:19839:98"/>ſome, and ſo declaring what he might lawfully haue done to both, but the more that are reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the brighter doth his grace ſhine vnto the elect. <hi>This is the higheſt grace of faith</hi> (ſaieth Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) <hi>to beleeue that he is mercifull, that ſaueth ſo few and condemneth ſo many.</hi> Thus by eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, is his glory aduaunced, which they detract from him that would haue the doctrin of reprobation ſuppreſſed and foiſted out of the church doores. And this is the firſt ende of reprobation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is the ſaluation of the elect as Auſtine <hi>tom.</hi> 7. <hi>lib. de praedeſt. &amp; gratia cap.</hi> 6. ſaith. <hi>Hee vvould haue the deſtruction of them that periſh to be an argument of ſaluation to them that are predeſtinated of him veſſels of mercie, and hee vſeth the death of ſome to the life of other: for the potter hath power ouer the clay to make of the ſame lump one veſſell to honour, another to diſhonor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The faluation of the elect is wrought by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reprobation two waies. 1. for that the elect are ſtirred vp with the thought that other are reprobated to feare and reuerence the power of God in them ſet forth. 2. ſeing by meditation of the ſame they growe to more knowledge &amp; feeling of the greatnes of gods grace to them ward, in as much as the elect do know that by nature they are not a whitt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the reprobate, and therefore cannot but diſcerne and ſee the excellencie of Gods grace to them ward: which is more euident &amp; ſweet vnto vs when wee thinke how it is deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:19839:98"/>vnto ſome as we make not ſo much accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a good thing that more haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſelues, as we do of that no more pertake. This may be declared by enumeration of Gods benefites that are temporall, both ſimplie in them ſelues, as of temporall life, riches, and honor, and in compariſon of ſpirituall gifts, as eternall life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting riches, heauenly promotion &amp;c. 1. Whereby we are ſtirred vp to a greater loue of God, for ſhewing ſo great loue to vs, in that God hath not reprobated vs as well as other. 2. Againe wee are mooued to abate our pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks traine and be humble, by knowledge of our vile vnworthines, no better by nature the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reprobate, to thinke baſely of our ſelues, ſo that if we will needs boaſt, wee boaſt onely in the Lord that hath not reiected vs a ſwell as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thou art not a reprobate, then bee hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be not proude, boaſt not in thy ſelfe, as if by thy deſert thou deſeruedſt not to be ſo: but boaſt in the Lord, that hath not made thee ſo as he made Eſau, Pharao, Saul, Iudas, Nero &amp;c. then whome thou wert not better, but like. 3. Laſtly we are moued to ſhew all thankfulnes to God for euer, gratefulnes to him for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probating vs, patience in aduerſitie thinking it inough that we haue the grace not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, ſtudie to do good works, confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce toward God, &amp; hope of euerlaſting life: which al they ſhal ſurely haue that are not reprobats. Thus the elect doe reap by reprobation great fruite, which they enuie them and defraude
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19839:99"/>them of, that would haue this doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation buried or more ſparingly handled in the church.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I denie the conſequence, for reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not the cauſe that they can do no other but ſinne, but the corrupt nature of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: who being euil trees cannot beare good fruite. Mat. 7.18. For the verie elect themſelues before regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not choſe but ſinne, but they that are borne of God ſinne no more. 1.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his dialogue with Trypho ſaying, <hi>God is not in fault that men or angells are predeſtinated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt: but euerie one is ſuch by his owne default as hee appears to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They except, why then doth he beſtow the grace of election vpon the elect and not vpon the reprobate. <hi>Janſ.</hi> with Auſtin in his booke <hi>de geneſi. ad lit. c.</hi> 10. <hi>God could conquer the wil of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The effects of reprobation are 1. a ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpp of the reprobate for God to ſhew his power and iuſtice in them. 2. a hiding of the miſterie of ſaluation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. 3. a breeding a reuerence in the elect of Gods power and iudgements toward the reprobate.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the effects, now followes of the ſubiects.<note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As all that God doth beffow eternall life vpon, are elected vnto eternall life, ſo contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all are reiected and excluded from it, that God will not beſtow it vpon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wee may know how many are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate by Chriſts words, <hi>few are choſen:</hi> for if it be ſo, then many are reprobate: and it is not more harſh to ſay, many are reprobated, then to ſay, <hi>many runne the broad way which leadeth to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Mat. 7.13. ſeing none are reprobate but ſuch as runne to deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore more are reprobate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elect. 1. becauſe more are condemned then ſaued: as Eſay cries ouer Iſrael and Paul repeats it. Rom. 9.27. <hi>Although the number of the children of Iſrael were as the ſand of the ſea, but a remnant ſhalbe ſaued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. More heare the word without profite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with profite, ſeing as appears Luc. 8.15. the fourth parte of the hearers onely receiue the

               <p n="4">4. The cauſes why God hath reiected more then elected, are, 1. becauſe he would: which will of his none can iuſtly reprehend. 2. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo it was the wiſeſt &amp; beſt courſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euery godly man muſt reſt. 3. The more are reiected, the greater ſhewes his grace to the elect, as his loue to the Iſraelites was more apparent in chooſing it alone vnto himſelfe &amp; refuſing all other, then if he had made choiſe of more. Deut. 7.7.4. the ſaluation of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is more ſet forward, the more are reiected. For the more they know are reprobated, the greater they know and feele his loue to them: and therefore are mooued to more thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to him, and ſtudie to make their election ſure.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The number of the reprobate is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with God, that it can neither be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor diminiſhed, nor chaunged: that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more nor leſſe can bee reprobated then were from euerlaſting. Thus farre of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts.</note>1. There are three neceſſarie adiuncts that enſue of Reprobation. The depriuing of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

They are ſure to abide both in this life and that to come moſt iuſtlie for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the vnchaungeablenes and certainetie of reprobation: which is ſuch: that as the elect cannot become reprobate: ſo the reprobate cannot become elect. And repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is immutable both in reſpect of God reprobating, in as much as he doth not chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, make voide, nor repeale, the decree of his will ſet downe from euerlaſting: and in reſpect of men reprobated, in that hauing not receaued ſauing grace they cannot but remaine in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, whereinto they voluntarie plunged themſelues: now he doeth not beſtow that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace vppon the reprobate, becauſe he is not bound to giue it, but hath mercie on whome be will.</p>
               <p>That reprobation is immutable, I prooue it thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe God is immutable, with whom

               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is his decree, made according to his good pleaſure, now all Gods decrees made according to the pleaſure of his will are vnchaungeable, or to ſpeake more plainclie, becauſe it is Gods will, and his will is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <p n="5">5. It is ioyned with his infallible preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therefore vnchaungeable.</p>

               <p n="1">1 If eternall reprobation be changeable, Gods purpoſe is ſo too: which is falſe. For if reprobation be the purpoſe of God, then if reprobation be chaungeable, his purpoſe is chaungeable: but it is: <hi>ergo.</hi>

               <p>Of which I thinke it not amiſſe to explane ſome, leaſt by their ambiguitie they trouble the rude and vnskilfull reader.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt <hi>Illumination,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Hebr. 6.4. is the ſame that baptiſme is: which by a metanymie of the cauſe, of the baptiſme of men of yeares that were inſtructed, was called illumination, whereupon <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is here taken for <hi>baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:19839:102"/>to be baptized: as Hebr. 10.32. and ſo doth the Syriack tranſlatour expound it, who makes <hi>to be inlightened</hi> in this place the ſame, that to goe into the water to be baptized. And ſo doth luſtin Martyr expound it, in his ſecond apologie for the Chriſtians to M. Antonius the Emperour. <hi>This waſhing is called illumination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their mindes that learne theſe things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened.</hi> The Apoſtles drift ſhewes this expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be true. For he admoniſhed ſuch as had beene baptized, not to become apoſtates. Whereupon in the verſe next before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he flattely nameth the doctrine of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes, by which they were inlightened, that before time had their vnderſtanding darkned with the cloudes of ignorance. This inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening of the vnderſtanding is in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate without the amendement or chaunge of their wills for the better, their vnderſtanding is inlightened with knowledge of the truth, but their will remaines vnchanged, neither is it turned vnto God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 There is aſcribed vnto them, <hi>a taſt of that heauenly gift,</hi> that is to ſay, of the ſweetenes of eternal life. This taſt they haue by knowledge onely, and not by any ſound fruition. As he that taſteth meate onely, is nor fedde of the ſame, nor nouriſhed by ſuch taſting: ſo ſome reprobates haue indeede a taſt of the ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of eternall life which God beſtoweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the elect, through a ſmackering of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19839:103"/>but enioy not the gift to the full frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing. Therefore that verye taſt is in a ſhort time gone and without fruite.</p>
               <p n="3">3. More then theſe ſome reprobates haue a participation of the holy Ghoſt, namely as much as pertaines to his operation that is common to the elect and reprobate. For that knowledge of the doctrine that bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which is great in ſome of the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and there ioy vpon that knowledge ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is wrought by the operation of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, but without any grace of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which the holy Ghoſt worketh in none but the elect, by his owne gratious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="4">4 They haue alſo a taſt of the good words of God, and of the vertues of the life to come, that is, their receiuing of the Goſpel with ioy, as is ſaide of the ſecond kinde of auditours, Luk. 8.33. which they are as glad of as if they enioyed the commodities of future bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And ſome haue ſanctification by the blood of the couenant, Hebr. 10.29. which is, no internall clenſing of their heart from ſinnes ſuch as befalleth the elect onely, and thoſe that haue the gift of ſauing faith: but a ſequeſtring of themſelues from the prophane without the Church, and a ioyning of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the companie of the faithfull, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19839:103"/>of baptiſme, which is the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the blood of the couenant. And this is the Apoſtles meaning, as is euident by his ſcope; becauſe he threatneth the apoſtates and backſliders from Chriſtianitie after recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of baptiſme. And leaſt any ſhould thinke it a ſmall matter after baptiſme to ſlide backe from Chriſts Church, he doth exaggerate this ſinne ſo, as he declareth that the Apoſtates that contemne and make light account of baptiſme, by which they were admitted into the Church and number of the faithfull, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne and make light account of the bloode of Chriſt, whereby the couenant of grace was eſtabliſhed. Beſides the text ſhewes to leſſe from the two and twentie verſe to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent place. The like is ſaid, Heb. 9.13. <hi>The blood of bulls and goates, and the aſhes of a heifer beeing sprinkled vpon the vncleane,</hi> is ſaide to ſanctifie them, namely figuratiuely and in a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To this doth Auguſtine agree, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling outward baptiſme viſible ſanctification.</p>
               <p>The oppoſites of eternall reprobation,<note place="margin">Oppoſites</note> are either Diſparates or Contraries. Thoſe are temporall excluſion from the Church of God for a time; Damnation, Commination of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Excluſion from the Church for a time, is either of the elect before they become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church by calling; or els of ſuch as are excommunicated.</p>
               <p>For God will haue all the elect be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19839:104"/>of the Church ſo ſoone as euer they be borne, but many times deferres their calling a long time, as he did Sergius Paulus, Dionyſius Areopagita, Damaris, Lydia the ſeller of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and many other; this their ſhutting out from the Church for a ſpace, is not that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting reprobation, neither were they that beleeued at Pauls preaching, Act. 13. reprobates before that. For it is ſaide in flat words, that they were ordained to euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</note> that ſame excommunication from the Church, cauſed of ſome publike ſcandall giuen, is not that euerlaſting reprobation. For it may be that one that is elected from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to euerlaſting life, may be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for giuing ſome offence, <hi>and deliuered to Satan, to the deſtruction of the fleſh, that his spirit may be ſaued in that day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as Paul ſpeakes, 1. Cor. 5.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, Damnation is diſparate from reprobation. For 1. reprobation is from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, damnation in time. 2. ſinne is the cauſe of damnation, ſo is it not of reprobation. It is neceſſarie to know this difference betweene them, for feare of confounding vnskilfully da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and reprobation together, and leaſt that which is ſaid of the one be fooliſhly refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Threatning of eternall death, differs alſo from reprobation.<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Election is contrarie vnto it. For when ſome
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19839:104"/>of mankinde are elect and ordained to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are neceſſarily to vnderſtand, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are refuſed and reprobate. We can not conceiue the one without the other, much leſſe can one be without the other. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries are by nature together.</p>
               <p>And thus hauing declared the diſſentanie arguments of it, I come to the comparates,<note place="margin">Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch as belong to the equalitie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie of reprobation and election.</p>
               <p>Reprobation is equall to election,<note place="margin">1 Paritie.</note> 1. in the efficient cauſes. For God is author of both, Gods good pleaſure or freewill is the motiue cauſe of both.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the matter. For both is the decree of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the endes: for both are for the glorie of God and ſaluation of the elect.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſubiect, which is mankind, in aſmuch as it was to be corrupted &amp; thrown into eternall death by their owne default. As then election is the decree of deliuering ſuch as are giuen to Chriſt by mercie out of the common deſtruction: ſo Reprobation is the decree to leaue ſuch as are not giuen to Chriſt in that common deſtruction by iuſtice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as election founde not men worthie but made them ſo, ſo reprobation <hi>caſt none</hi> into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death, but by iuſt iudgement leaues them that are plunged into it by their owne ſinne and fault in it. For as God decreed not to chooſe any that was iuſt alreadie, but the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19839:105"/>ſinner to be made iuſt by grace, ſo likewiſe he did not decree to reprobate the iuſt, but the ſinner to be iuſtly condemned for ſinne.</p>
               <p n="5">5 In the adiuncts both were from eternall: both are firme and immutable: both not to be altered, whether you reſpect Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or the perſons themſelues elected or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated. So that neither the counſell of God can poſſibly be made fruſtrate, nor the elect become reprobates, nor the reprobates e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>The inequalitie or vnlikelines of reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and election,<note place="margin">2 Diſparitie</note> appeares in theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 In the forme. For as election is a decree of pitying and deliuering out of the vniuerſall ruine, and taking into ſaluation: ſo reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a decree of not pitying but relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the common waſt, and of not vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing of ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the effects. For inward calling, faith, iuſtification, glorification, good workes, and eternall ſaluation, are the effects of election: but debarring from the grace of inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and faith, and iuſtification, glorification, good works, and the bleſſing of ſaluation, and ſinnes, and the puniſhments of the ſame, are not the effects of reprobation.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the proper ſubiects. For election is of ſuch as ſhall be ſaued, reprobation of them that are to be condemned.</p>
               <p n="4">4 In the enſuing adiuncts. For though ſinne
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19839:105"/>bee not the cauſe of reprobation, yet it is of damnation: for no man is condemned but for ſinne: but the good works of the godly, as they are not the cauſe of election ſo neither of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely the way that God hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the godly to walk in. Eph. 2.10. <hi>We are his workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip framed in Chriſt Ieſus to good warks, which God hath prepared that vve ſhould vvalke in them:</hi> Nowe as the way is not the cauſe of the mark, ſo are not good works the cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus laid forth the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parates, now comed to the Coniugate.</p>
               <p>Of the miſterie of Reprobation they that are to be condemned are called reprobats: of whome theſe poſitions following muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The reprobates are reprobated of God according to his good pleaſure, and free, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and iuſt will: becauſe <hi>God doth all things of the counſell of his owne will.</hi> Eph. 1.11. ſo ſaieth a certaine Prophet to Amazia king of Iudah 2.

               <p>Now he ſpeaketh of the continuance of the creation of man as he is after the fall. God had made the firſt man, pure, holy, godly, but after the fall ſuch, as he is, of the maſſe whereof hee made him: that is, corrupt of a corrupt lump, and by nature the child of wrath: for none are borne holy, but al are borne wicked.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19839:107"/>which is this.</p>
               <p>Peter exhorteth thoſe that beleeue, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a holy life, they would be edified more &amp; more, as it were liuing ſtones in Chriſt Ieſus. Now that the faithfull muſt be edified in Ieſus Chriſt, he prooueth thus: becauſe he is that ſtone which God hath laid in Sion in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the corner, in which ſtone whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeueth ſhall not be aſhamed. Out of this promiſe made to the beleeuers, Peter drawes this conſequence. <hi>Therefore to you it is an honor that beleeue:</hi> that he doth amplifie by that that is vnlike: <hi>But to the diſobedient hee is a ſtumbling block and a rock of offence.</hi> How that is, he ſhewes in the next wordes: ſaying that they ſtumble at the worde. Nowe leaſt any might thinke that is by meere chaunce, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith moreouer, <hi>that they are ſet for this purpoſe,</hi> namely to ſtumble at the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. So then there are three thinges in this ſpeach that may breede any doubt, Firſt to what the diſobedient were ſet, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by whome, thirdlie what that is, <hi>they vvere ſet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the firſt, they were ſet to this, that they might ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble at the preaching of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt, and that by the iuſt iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, by this meanes puniſhing the ſinnes of the diſobedient with ſinnes.

                  </gap> to the whole oration next before going, ſeing there is no word of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19839:108"/>newter gender before to referre it to: if it bee not abſurd that Chriſt is ſet for a downefall for many, no more is it, that many ſhould be ſet for this to ſtumble at the preaching and ſo fall.</p>
               <p>They were ſet for this of god, as a iuſt iudge, by that meanes reuenging the ſinnes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and ſtubburne Scribes and Phariſes, and puniſhing them with ſinnes. For all ſinne is either a proofe and declaration of mans frailty, as was the tranſgreſſion of our fore-fathers (whome God ſuffered to fall to manifeſt and make proofe of the greatnes of mans weaknes, &amp; how litle auailable euen the moſt innocent man of all other is, vnleſſe he be vpheld by Gods eſpecial grace) or els a iuſt chaſtiſement, as are moſt of the ſinnes of the holy, or els a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of former ſinnes, or the merite of greater ſinnes and puniſhments, as are all the ſinnes of the reprobats.</p>
               <p>Therefore they are not placed to this of themſelues: and it is not more abſurd that the diſobedient are placed to this of God, to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the preaching of the goſpell, then for Chriſt to be ſet of God in Sion a ſtone to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at, a rock of offence, or that the miniſters of the goſpell ſhould be a good ſauour vnto god at the very time that they are a ſauour of death vnto death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>They were put,</hi> is the ſame that they were ordained, appointed, and by conſequence ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp and framed as Paul ſpeakes Rom. 9.17.

But I ſhall not be able to explane theſe things rightly vnto you, as I know you looke for at my handes, vnleſſe you become an humble ſuter to God for me, by whoſe helpe beeing made ſomething more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I willingly come to the point. And firſt I meane to betake my ſelfe to the full intent, and ſcope of the Apoſtle, quite through the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, which I will chiefly reſpect. And that intent, I take it to be this; That no man boaſt
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:19839:111"/>him of his good deedes, as the Iſraelites did, becauſe they had beene obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the law which was giuen them, thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on challenging wholly vnto themſelues the grace of the Goſpel of God, as due to them by deſert, and denying that it was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Gentiles, who were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnworthie of it, vnleſſe they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſacraments of the Iewes. The which doubt, is cleared in the Acts of the Apoſtles. For they vnderſtoode not, that euen for this cauſe, becauſe it is the grace of the Goſpel, therefore it is not due to workes. Otherwiſe this grace ſhould now be no grace at all. And this is in many places teſtified by faith, preferring grace before workes, not that it might thereby cleane extinguiſh workes; but that it might ſhew how workes doe not goe before grace, but rather followe it: and that no man therefore: ought to thinke, that he hath receiued grace, becauſe he hath wrought well; but rather that he could not poſſibly haue wrought thus wel, vnleſſe he had firſt receiued grace by faith. Now a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth then to receiue grace, when beeing ſtirred to faith, in or by ſome earthly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he beginneth to beleeue in God. But it concerneth vs to know at what time, or cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the lacraments, a more full and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident grace is infuſed into vs. For euen thoſe which haue not beene inſtructed, doe not beleeue, or elſe C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19839:112"/>his giuing of almes, and making of praiers, he ſeemed worthie to haue an Angel ſent vnto him. But, had he not firſt beleeued, he would neuer haue wrought ſuch thinges. Neither would he euer haue beleeued, vnleſſe he had bin called, either by the ſecret admonitions of his minde, and ſpirit; or elſe by the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt warnings through the ſenſes and parts of his bodie. But ſome haue onely ſo much grace of faith, as that they can not attaine vnto the kingdome of heauen thereby; as thoſe which are newly taught, and as Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius before he was made a member of the Church, by the participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſacraments. Now contrariwiſe, this grace of faith is ſo great in others, that they be euen now repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted members of Chriſt and of the Church of God. <hi>For the temple of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>is holy, which you are.</hi> And this is the Lords owne ſaying, <hi>Vnleſſe a man be borne of water and the holy Ghoſt, be can not enter into the kingdome of heauen.</hi> There are then certaine beginnings of faith, much like vnto conceptions, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we moſt not onely be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but alſo borne, that we may fully enioy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life. Neither is any thing of all theſe, without the grace of the great mercie of God; becauſe if there be any good workes, they follow this grace, as we ſaide before, and can in no wiſe be before in. Which thing the Apoſtle beeing very deſirous to perſwade vs, becauſe, as he mentioneth in an other place;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19839:112"/>it is not from vs, but it is the gift of God, not by reaſon of our workes, leaſt peraduenture any man ſhould extoll himſelfe, he ſpake of them which were not yet borne. For no man could ſay that Iacob beeing now vnborne did mooue God by his workes to ſpeake of him: And the elder ſhall ſerue the younger. Therefore, ſaith he, not onely Iſaac was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, when it was ſaide, About this time I will come and Sara ſhall haue a ſonne, who by no meanes may be thought to haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Gods handes by his workes, to be thus promiſed before his birth, and that the ſeede of Abraham ſhould be called in Iſaac. That is to ſay, That thoſe ſhould belong to the companie of the Saints, which is in Chriſt, who knewe them-ſelues to be the ſonnes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not waxing proude vpon any of their owne deſerts, but imputing it wholly to the grace of vocation, that they were made fellow heyres with Chriſt. For when they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed onely, it could not be that they as yet deſerue any thing, before they themſelues had any beeing. But Rebecca alſo hauing brought forth after one copulation with our father Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac, vttereth this ſaying very circumſpectly. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one copulation. For ſhee conceiued a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, leaſt peraduenture, it might be attributed to the fathers deſerts, if ſome man ſhould ſpeake on this manner; The ſonne is thus, or thus, becauſe at the very ſame inſtant that he
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19839:113"/>was placed into the wombe of the mother, the father was thus, or thus affected: or becauſe the mother was thus affected when ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him. For both Iſaac begot them both at one time, and Rebecca at the ſame time conceiued them both. To commende this thing vnto vs, ſhee ſpeaketh thus, By one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. That ſhee might neither leaue any place here for the Aſtrologian, or rather to that kinde of ſoothſaier, who by the nariuitie is woont to coniecture of the conditions, and fortune of thoſe which are borne. For they haue nothing to alleadge for themſelues, why at the ſame conception, likewiſe at the ſame moment, the conſtitution of the heauens, and planets nothing differing, when euery thing did ſo ioyntly agree, there was ſuch great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt that couple. And they may eaſily perceiue, if they pleaſe, that thoſe their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers which they ſell to poore diſtreſſed wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, proceede not from any art, or skill they haue, but onely from a caſual kinde of ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But to leaue all things not pertinent to our matter. Theſe things are rehearſed to break the neck of their pride, who are ſo vnthankfull for the grace of God, and dare boaſt of their owne deſerts. For when they were yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and had done neither good nor euill, not for their works, but in regard of him who called them, it was ſaide vnto him, that the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhal ſerue the yonger. This grace therfore is
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19839:113"/>his who calleth, &amp; conſequently good works are his who receiueth this grace; yet not ſo as that they were the bringers forth of grace, but rather themſelues were brought forth by grace: euen as the fire doth not heare other things that it ſelfe may be hotte, but becauſe it ſelfe is hotte, nor the wheele doth therefore runne ſmoothly that it may be round, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is round: ſo no man doth therefore effect good workes, that he may hereafter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue grace, but becauſe he hath alreadie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it. For how can he liue righteouſly who hath not beene iuſtified, or he holily, who hath not beene ſanctified, or he at all liue, who hath not had life miniſtred vnto him? Now grace doth iuſtifie, that he which is iuſtified may liue righteouſly. Grace therefore is firſt, and then follow good workes, as he ſaith in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. But to him which worketh there is a reward aſcribed, not according to grace, but according to debt: As that immortalitie after good workes, yet if it be required as due, as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, I haue fought a good fight, I haue runne my race, and kept my faith, and nowe there remaines a crowne of iuſtice for me, which the Lord beeing a iuſt and vpright iudge ſhall render vnto me in that day. For happily becauſe he ſaide, he ſhall render, it is now vpon debt. But when he aſcending lead captiuitie cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, he did not render, but beſtowed gifts vpon men. For whereupon I pray you
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19839:114"/>ſhould the Apoſtle preſume, that it was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as dew, vnleſſe he had before receiued grace which was not dew, whereby being iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, he fought a good fight? For he was a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and a doer of wrong; but he obtained mercie, as himſelfe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth; beleeuing verely in him, who iuſtifieth not the godly, but the vngodly, that by iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him he may make him godly: not in regard of their works, ſaieth he, but in regard of him which calleth, it is ſaid vnto him, that the elder ſhall ſerue the younger. Hither tendeth that which he ſaith, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were yet vnborne, and had done nothing, either good or euill, that it might be ſaid, not for their works, but in regard of him that calleth: whereuppon it commeth to my minde to enquire, wherefore he ſaid, that Gods purpoſe might remaine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his election. For how may that be called, not onely a iuſt election, but ſo much as a bare election, where there is no difference? For if Iacob, vnborne as yet, &amp; hauing wrought nothing, was not choſe for any deſert of his, neither could he be choſen at all, there being no difference whereby he might be choſen; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if Eſau was diſliked without any deſert, becauſe he was as yet vnborne &amp; had wrought nothing: when it was ſaid, and the elder ſhall ſerue the younger: how can his reproofe bee thought iuſt? with what diſcretion therfore, or with what proportion of equitie, do we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which followeth, I haue loued Iacob,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19839:114"/>but hated Eſau? which thing is ſet downe in a Prophet, who was long after their birth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring. But yet that ſentence ſhould ſeeme to haue beene ſpoken whereby it is ſaid, and the elder ſhal ſerue the younger, before they were borne or had yet wrought any thing: Where-hence therefore is this election, or what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of election may it bee thought to bee, if theſe two being yet vnborne, and cleane voide of works, there were no quantitie of deſert? or wil you ſay that their natures &amp; eſſences did ſome thing differ? who can euer gather this by one father, one mother, one copulation, one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker? Or did the ſame maker, as he brought forth diuers kindes of liuing creatures and mates, out of the ſame earth: ſo out of the ſame marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of man and woman raiſe a diuers iſſue which he might partly affect, and partly hate? There was no election therefore, before there was that which might be elected. For if Iacob were made good to the intent that hee might pleaſe, how did hee ſo pleaſe before hee was, that he might be made good? Therefore he was not choſen that he might be made good, but being now made good he might verie well be choſen. What therefore according to electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe God foreſeeing all things, had alſo a foreſight into Iacobs future faith being yet vnborne? That although euery man do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be iuſtified by his works, ſince he is not able to worke: but being iuſtified, yet becauſe God doth iuſtifie the nations by faith, and no
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19839:115"/>man beleeueth but of a freewil, God foreſeing the future will to beleeue, choſe him before he was borne, vpon the foreſight wherby he iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him. If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be through the meanes of this foreſight, and God did foreſee the faith of Iacob, what proofe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you bring for it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hee choſe him not nowe in regard of his works? But becauſe neither of them was yet borne, nor had done good or euill, hitherto likewiſe neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had beleeued. But as by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this foreknowledge he had an inſight into his future beliefe, ſo by the ſame he might aſſure himſelfe of his works which were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. That as he is ſaid to be choſen for the after faith, which God was priuie to before hand, ſo ſome other bodie may affirme, that he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſen for thoſe works of his which were to come, whereof notwithſtanding God had a certaine foreſight. Whereuppon therefore the Apoſtle ſheweth, that it was not ſpoken by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their works, And the elder ſhall ſerue the younger; but becauſe they were not yet borne, it was not onely not ſpoken in regard of their works, but euen without any reſpect of their faith alſo, becauſe before their birth, they had no iotte at all of either of them. He would not therefore haue vs vnderſtand that by this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there was choiſe made of the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that the elder ſhould ſerue him; for being deſirous to ſhew that works were not the cauſe of this election, he did add this vppon ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſaying, for when they were yet vnborn, &amp;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19839:115"/>had done neither good nor euill. Otherwiſe might it haue bin obiected to him: yea but god did now know whatſoeuer he was to do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Wherefore, may it be demaunded, where hence did this election ſpring? becauſe certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it could in no wiſe ariſe from works, which in theſe yet not borne, were none at al; nor from faith which was euen as little to be ſeene in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the other. Shall we ſay that there could be no election, ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as there appeared no diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie either of faith, or works, or any deſerts at all in the wombe of the mother? But it is ſaid, that the decree of god might remain according to the election, &amp; we therefore demaund be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid, vnleſſe peraduenture we muſt make this diſtinction vppon the ſentence, that we do not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it to be ſpoken not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the works, but in regard of him which calleth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid, And the elder ſhal ſerue the younger, that the decree of God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine according to election; but thus rather, that no election at all being here vnderſtood, we ſhould receiue this as an example of thoſe who were neither yet borne, nor had wrought any thing at all. For whilſt they were yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, &amp; had done nothing, either good or euil, that the decree of God might remaine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is to ſay, and had done ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor ill, in ſo much that for the verie, actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there might be ſome choiſe made of him who had done wel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Since therfore there was no choiſe of the wel doer, according to which the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19839:116"/>decree of god might remaine, not in regard of works, but of him which calleth: that is to ſay, of him which by calling the vngodly to faith through grace, doth iuſtifie him, it is ſaid, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the elder ſhal ſerue the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. Therefore the decree of god doth not remaine according to electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the decree: which is in effect as much as one ſhould ſay, the decree of gods iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not therfore remaine, becauſe God hath fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any good works in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he may chooſe. but becauſe that doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine that he may iuſtifie thoſe which beleeue therefore hath he found out works, which hee may chooſe for the kingdome of heauen. For were there no election, what elect could there be? or how might it be well ſaid, who ſtood ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer againſt the elect of God? yet election go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not before iuſtification, but iuſtification before election. For, what ſhould any be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, vnleſſe there were ſome difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and the reiected perſon? Wherev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon I know not what to make of the ſaying, becauſe God hath choſen vs before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world, vnleſſe I ſhould thinke that here is vnderſtood foreknowledge. But whereas he ſaith in this place; It was ſaid vnto him not in regard of workes, but of him who calleth, becauſe the elder ſhal ſerue the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, he wold haue the place thus interpreted, not by choiſe of merits, which ſhew themſelues after the iuſtification of grace, but by the infinitenes of Gods rewards, leaſt ſome man ſhould boaſt
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19839:116"/>himſelfe of his works. For we are ſaued by the grace of God: And this proceedeth not from workes, but it is the benefite of God; not from works leaſt ſome man peraduenture ſhould be puffed vp. Now there ariſeth a doubt by the way, whether faith merit a mans iuſtification, or it be rather to be thought that the deſerts of faith, do not go before the mercie of God, but the faith is rather to bee accounted amongſt the gifts of grace. Becauſe euen in this place, when he had ſaid, not by workes: he doth not preſently inferre, but by reaſon of faith it was ſaid vnto him, becauſe the elder ſhall ſerue the younger, but this is it which he addeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, but for his ſake which calleth. For no man beleeueth, vnleſſe he be called: Nowe the mercifull God calleth, giuing thus much to no merits of faith, becauſe they rather follow vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation then goe before it: for how ſhall they beleeue him whome they haue not ſeene? and how ſhall they heare vnleſſe ſome man telleth them? If therefore in calling, the mercie of god go not before, neither without doubt can a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleeue, that hereby he may begin to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and receiue power to do well: Grace then is before all deſert: For Chriſt died for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Wherefore it was giuen to the younger that the elder ſhould ſerue him, not for any deſerts of his owne, but in regard of him who calleth, and that ſhould bee imputed to the calling of God, &amp; not to Iacobs works where it is written, I haue loued Iacob. But what was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19839:117"/>the reaſon that Eſau ſerued his younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that it was thus written of him, but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau haue I hated? what euill had he committed whereby he deſerued this, being yet vnborne and hauing done neither good nor euill when this was ſpoken of him, and the elder ſhall ſerue the younger? Or will you ſay, that as that was ſpoken of Iacob for no good thing done on his part: ſo this is alſo ſaid of Eſau for no badd deed of his that he was hated? For if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God foreknew his bad works which he was to performe hereafter, he was therefore predeſtinated to ſerue his younger brother, by the ſame reaſon was Iacob predeſtinated alſo to be ſerued by his elder brother, becauſe God foreſaw his future good works: And then it is verie falſe which he ſaith, not by works. If then it bee true, that there was not ſuch force of works, and he proues that after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was ſpoken of thoſe which were yet vnborne, and had wrought nothing, &amp; likewiſe if faith be of as little moment, which they were euen as much naked of before their birth, how could Eſau deſerue to be hated, being as yet vnborne? For without all queſtion God made thoſe things which he loued. And there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of ſcripture which will condemne vs of great abſurditie, if we ſay he made thoſe things which he hated, for nether wouldſt thou haue ordained any thing that thou bateſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haſt thou hated any of theſe things which thou haſt ordained. For vpon what deſert was
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19839:117"/>the ſunne made to be the ſunne, or in what thing had the moone offended that it was made ſo much inferiour to the ſunne, or what had it deſerued whie by the creation thereof it ſhould ſo much exceede the other ſtarres in brightnes? But all theſe things beeing good were ſeuerally made in their kinde. For God would not ſay I haue loued the ſunne and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moone, or I haue loued the moone, and hated the other ſtarres, as he ſaide I haue loued Iacob, but Eſau haue I hated. But God loued all thoſe things, notwithſtanding their difference in excellencie, becauſe he ſaw that they were good, when they were ordained at his word: but there was no ſhew of iuſtice, that without ſome merit of iniuſtice, he ſhould haue hated Eſau. VVhich beeing graunted, it wil neceſſarily follow, that Iacob was alſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for ſome merit of righteouſnes. And if this be true, that is moſt falſe, to ſay, he was not loued for his works. Or will you ſay it was for the vprightnes of his faith. I pray you what haue gained by this, ſince they beeing yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, could not poſſibly haue any vprightnes of faith? The Apoſtle very well perceiued therefore, what might ariſe out of theſe words to the minde of the hearer and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ader, and for this cauſe immediatly added this which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, VVhat ſhall we ſay? Is there any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſnes with God? god forbid. And tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that it cannot be ſo: For, ſaith he, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Moſes thus: I will take compaſſion on
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19839:118"/>him, of whome I will haue compaſſion, and ſhew mercie to him, of whome I wil haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. By which words whether hath he releaſed vs of our former doubts thinke you, or rather increaſed the ſame? For herein conſiſts the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry head of all our doubts; If he takes compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on him, of whome he hath compaſſion, and ſhew mercie to him of whome he hath mercie, why did not Eſau finde this mercie, that as Iacob, ſo he might alſo therby be made good. VVas this the cauſe why it was ſaid, I will haue compaſſion on him of whome I will haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and will ſhew mercie to him of whom I will haue mercie, becauſe whomſoeuer God of his mercie calleth, him alſo of his mercie he cauſeth to beleeue: and whome of his mercie he cauſeth to beleeue, to him alſo he will ſhew mercie, that is, he will make him merciful, that thereupon he may worke well? VVhereby we are admoniſhed, that a man ought not to boaſt and puffe vp himſelfe with the bare workes of mercie, as though by them as by his own works he hath woon God vnto him, ſince he receiued mercie it ſelfe through his meanes, who will take compaſſion on him, of whome he will haue compaſſion. But if any man will bragge that he hath deſerued it by beleeuing, let him know that he was the ground of this beleefe, who by the inſpiration of faith, taketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion vpon him of whome he will take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, that yet he might impart vocation to the vnbeleeuer. For there is now ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19839:118"/>betwixt the faithfull and the wicked. For ſaith he, what haſt thou that thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued? and hauing receiued it, why ſhouldeſt thou bragge as if thou hadſt not receiued it? Indeede this is well, but why was Eſau abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of this mercie, that ſo he might not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and haue faith inſpired into him beeing called, and by this faith be made mercifull, that thereby he might doe good workes? or was it becauſe he himſelfe refuſed it? why then if Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob did therefore beleeue becauſe himſelfe would, God beſtowed not this faith vpon him, but himſelfe by his willingnes gained it to himſelfe, and ſo he had ſomething which he did not receiue. Or doth God worke faith in men by calling them, becauſe no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue vnleſſe he be willing, nor any man be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling except he be called, nor no man by his owne power worke his owne calling? becauſe bowſoeuer a man can not poſſibly beleeue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will yet without vocation he can in no wiſe beleeue. For how ſhall they beleeue him whome they haue not heard? or how ſhall they heare vnleſſe it be preached vnto them? Therefore no man beleeueth but he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor doth euery one which is called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. For many are called, but few are choſen. As alſo whoſoeuer haue not contemned the caller, but followed him by beleefe, without doubt they haue beleeued willingly. But what followes? Therefore it is the power neither of him that willeth, nor yet of him which o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19839:119"/>but of God onely which taketh compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Or becauſe vve cannot ſo much as vvill vnleſſe vve be called, and our vvill is of no force to performe vvithout Gods aſſiſtance. VVe muſt therefore both be vvilling and alſo ſpeedie. For that vvas not ſpoken in vaine, and in earth the peace of good vvill vnto men, and ſo runne, that you may take hold of. Yet it is in the povver neither of him that vvilleth, not him that runneth, but onely of God vvho ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth compaſſion, that we may attain vnto that vvhich vve deſire, and come thither vvhither vve vviſh to come. Eſau therefore refuſed, and vvould not runne, but although he had both beene vvilling and had alſo runne, yet it ſhould haue beene the aide of God vvhich ſhould haue brought him vvhither he vvould, vvho al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by calling him ſhould cauſe him both to vvill and runne, vnleſſe neglecting his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he vvould become a reprobate. For God doth one vvay cauſe vs to be vvilling, and an other vvay cauſe that to haue effect vvhich vve doe will and deſire. For it hath pleaſed him that it ſhould proceede partly from him, and partly from our ſelues to will any thing. But whatſoeuer it is that we do deſire, it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wholly from him; that is to ſay, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe well, and to liue bleſſedly. But Eſau being yet vnborne could neither will nor nill. VVhy then was he diſliked being in the womb of his mother? For he betakes himſelfe againe to thoſe difficulties, which are much more
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19839:119"/>troubleſome, not only in regard of their owne obſcurenes, but alſo of our ſo often recitall. For why was Eſau reiected being yet vnborn, who could neither beleeue him which called, nor contemne the vocation, nor doe either good or euill, without Gods foreknowledge of that future ill diſpoſition of his? why was not Iacob alſo approoued by Gods foreſight into his good diſpoſition which was to come? Now let it be but once granted, that any man was euer either approoued, or reprooued, for that which was neuer hitherto found in him, onely becauſe God did foreſee that it would be in him, it may be here hence very eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that he might alſo be approoued by thoſe works which God did foreſee would be afterward in him, although he had not yet wrought any thing. And that will make very little to our purpoſe, that they were yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, when it was ſaide, And the elder ſhall ſerue the younger, hereby to ſhew it was not ſpoken in regard of workes, becauſe he had not yet wrought any thing. And beſides, if you marke thoſe wordes well, Therefore it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the power of him that runneth, nor of him that willeth, but of God which taketh compaſſion, you ſhall ſee that it is not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles drift hereby onely to prooue, that we come to that which we deſire by the aſſiſtance of God, but alſo to ſignifie that which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth in another place, when he ſaith, With feare and trembling worke your owne ſafetie,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19839:120"/>for it is God which worketh in vs both to will and to worke according to his owne good pleaſure. VVhere he makes it very plaine, that euen the very will to good is cauſed, God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in vs. For if this be the onely ende of that ſaying, It is neither in the power of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God which taketh compaſſion, becauſe mans will of it ſelfe is not ſufficiently able to make vs line vprightly and well, without Gods mercie aiding vs, why may not it be ſaid as well after this manner. Therefore it is not in the power of God which taketh compaſſion, but of man that willeth, becauſe Gods mercie alone is not of force enough, vnleſſe the agreeablenes of our will be added thereto? But that is moſt manifeſt, that our wil is not worth a ruſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods mercie. And yet me thinks that I can not tell what to ſay to the inferring of theſe words, That God taketh compaſſion to no ende vnleſſe we be willing. For it neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followes that we be willing, if God once take compaſſion. For it belongs to the ſame mercie, that we be willing. For it is God who according to his owne good pleaſure worketh in vs both to will, and to doe. For I ſhould woonder if any man would denie me that our will to good were the gift of God. Novv be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our vvill to good doth not goe before vocation, but vocation before it, therefore it is moſt iuſtly attributed to God that vve vvill, but by no meanes to vs, that vve are called.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19839:120"/>VVe muſt not therefore thinke that this is the cauſe vvhy it is ſaide, Therefore it is not in the povver either of him vvhich runneth, or him vvhich vvilleth, but of God vvhich taketh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, becauſe vve cannot attaine vnto that vvhich vve deſire vvithout his helpe, but rather becauſe vve haue no vvill vvithout his vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if this vocation be the cauſe of a mans vvill to that vvhich is good, in ſo much that vvhoſoeuer is called attaineth to it, hovv then can that be true, Many are called, but fevv are choſen? VVhich if it be ſo, and he vvhich is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led doe not conſequently obey this calling, and moreouer it be in his vvill vvhither he vvill obey it, it may be very vvell ſaid, It is not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the povver of God that taketh compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but of man vvhich doth both vvill, and runne: becauſe the mercie of him vvhich calleth is not ſufficient, vnleſſe there follovv a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine obedience of him vvhich is called. Or, it may be, that thoſe vvhich beeing thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led doe not agree, beeing othervviſe called, could applie their vvill to faith, vvhereby that might be alſo true, Many are called, but fevv are choſen. In ſo much that, notvvithſtanding many are alike called, yet becauſe all are not alike affected, they onely doe attaine vnto this vocation vvho are found fitte for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing thereof: and that is euen as true, Therefore it is neither in the povver of him vvhich vvilleth, nor of him vvhich runneth, but of God vvhich taketh compaſſion, vvho ſo
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19839:121"/>called as he iudged it to be fitte for them vvho attained to this calling. Novv there came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a calling to the lotte of other men, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it vvas ſuch a one, as that they could not be mooued thereby, nor vvere fitte to receiue it, they might indeede be tearmed called, but not choſen. And novv it is not likevviſe true, Therefore it is not in the povver of God vvhich taketh compaſſion, but of man vvhich vvilleth; and runneth, becauſe the vvorking of Gods mercie can not be in mans povver, in ſo much that his mercie ſhould be of no force if man were vnwilling. Becauſe if he would haue mercie vpon men he might ſo call them, as it was fitte for them, both to be ſtirred vp to vnderſtand, and attaine to the ſame. It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very true, Many are called, but few are choſen. For thoſe are elected who are congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly called; but they which did not agree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, nor obey their vocation, howſoeuer they were called, yet are they not choſen, becauſe they attained not vnto this vocation. Againe this is true; It is neither in the power of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God which taketh compaſſion on, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he call many, yet amongſt thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he taketh compaſſion on them onely who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſo calleth as it is meete for them that they may attain vnto this vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But contrariwiſe moſt falſe if any man ſay, therefore it is not in the power of God which taketh compaſſion: but of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which willeth and runneth, becauſe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19839:121"/>God taketh compaſſion of no man in vaine, but he ſo calleth whomeſoeuer he taketh pitie on, as he knoweth it to bee meete for him, to withhold him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> refuſing him which calleth. But here will ſome man ſay, why then was not Eſau ſo called that he had a deſire to obey? For we ſee diuers men to bee moued by the ſame things ſundry wayes ſhewed and ſignified, to beleeue, as for example, Simeon beleeued in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt being yet a little infant, acknowledging him by the reuelation of the ſpirit. Nathanael after one ſentence which hee heard from his mouth, before Philip called thee, when thou wert vnder the figge tree I ſaw thee, aunſwered, Maiſter, thou art the ſonne of god, thou art the king of Iſrael. Which becauſe Peter confeſſed ſo long after, he deſerued to heare, that he was bleſſed, and that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen ſhould bee giuen vnto him. After he had done that miracle of turning water into wine, in Canaan a citie of Galilee, which the Euangeliſt S. Iohn reporteth to be the entrance to his other ſignes &amp; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, his diſciples preſently beleeued in him. He trayned diuers to beleeue by ſpeaking, &amp; many beleeued not although he had raiſed the dead to life again. His diſciples being terrified as concerning his croſſe and paſſion, did ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and yet that theefe did then beleeue, not when he ſaw him ſo excell in his works, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hung on the ſame croſſe with him. And one of his diſciples, after he was riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19839:122"/>beleeued not ſo much his liuing parts, as the freſh wounds which had beene made in his fleſh. Many of them by whom he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, who contemned him when they ſaw him worke miracles, beleeued his diſciples prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of him afterwards, and working the like things in his name. Since therefore one man is ſtirred vp to faith one way, and another ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, yea and oftentimes the ſame thing diuerſly vttered worketh diuerſly alſo in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers perſons, mouing or not moouing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it is vttered, who dares ſay that that kinde of calling was wanting, whereby Eſau might applie his minde, &amp; ioyne his will to that faith, wherein Iacob was iuſtified. But if there can be ſuch great ſtubburnes of the will, that the frowardnes of the minde can harden it ſelf againſt all meanes of calling: I aske further whether this hardnes bee a puniſhment infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by God or not? For when God doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake vs by not ſo calling vs, as we may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to faith, who will alſo ſay, that the meanes whereby wee might be perſuaded to beleeue, was wanting to the almighty? But why ſhould we make any queſtion of this, ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle addeth this immediatly: For the ſcripture ſaith to Pharao, becauſe I haue ſtirred thee vpp hereto, that I might ſhew my power in thee, &amp; that my name might be reported through the whole earth? Now the Apoſtle annexed this ſaying, that he might thereby proue that which he had ſaid before: therefore it is neither in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:19839:122"/>power of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God which taketh compaſſion. For, as if ſome man ſhould queſtion with him, what ground haue you for this? he aunſwers, becauſe the ſcripture ſaith to Pharao, becauſe I haue ſtirred thee vp to this ende, that I might ſhew my power in thee, &amp; that my name might be made knowne ouer the whole earth. And as he ſheweth here that it is neither in the power of him that willeth nor of him that runneth: but of God which taketh compaſſion, ſo hee ſhutteth vp this: therefore he taketh pittie of whome he will and hardeneth whome he will, ſince both of them were not mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For it is not all one to ſay, it is neither in the power of him which willeth, nor of him which runneth, but of God which taketh compaſſion, and to inferre it thus: It is not in the power of him which willeth and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but of God which hardeneth. Wherehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we may vnderſtand that as that which in the latter place hee hath ſet downe both wayes, therefore he hath compaſſion on whom he wil, and hardeneth whom he will, may thus be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the former meaning, that the harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God be thought to be his vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to mercy, not that any of this be abrogated from man to make him worſe, but onely that he arrogate nothing to himſelfe to make him better, then indeed he is. But if there be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made of deſerts, who hath not cauſe to burſt forth into that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of the Apoſtles?
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19839:123"/>Doeſt thou then aske of me why he doth yet complaine, ſince no man reſiſts his will? For God complaines oftentimes of men, as may appeare by many places of the ſcripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not beleeue, and like wel: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the faithfull and thoſe which do the wil of God, are ſaid to be conuerſant without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, becauſe the ſcripture complaineth not of them. But why doth he complaine, ſaith he, ſince no man reſiſts his will, he taking compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on whome he will, and hardning whome he pleaſe? But let vs looke into that which we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before, what the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall we ſay? Is there any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes with God? God forbidd. Let this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be rooted in the minde of euerie faithfull and religious man, that there is no wickednes with God; and let this be a chiefe point of our faith, whereunto we may ſtick cloſe, that this which is ſpoken of God, that he will take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion vpon whome he will take compaſſion, &amp; harden whome he will: that is, that of whom it pleaſeth him to haue mercie, he will, and of whome it pleaſeth him not, he will not, that this I ſay; is a hidden point of his equitie, and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per then mans ſhall ownes is able to ſearch into which is to be obſerued in al humaine affairs &amp; earthly contracts, wherein vnleſſe we ſhould retaine ſome prints of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly iuſtice, the ſcope of our weake capacitie would neuer be able to looke vp or prye into the admirable ſecrecie, holines, and purenes, of ſpirituall precepts. Bleſſed are they which hunger and thirſt after
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19839:123"/>righteouſnes, becauſe they ſhal be filled. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnleſſe we were cheriſhed with ſome ſmal blaſts of righteouſnes deſcending from aboue, whilſt we be combred with this mortall life &amp; condition, we ſhould firſt wither awaye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would euer thirſt. Wherefore ſince the fellowſhip of man is, as it were tied together, with a mutuall kinde of giuing and receiuing, and thoſe things are giuen and receiued mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, which are either due, or contrarie, who ſees not that no man can bee iuſtly accuſed of vniuſtice, who demaunds that which is due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which is willing to forgiue, that which is due vnto him? But this is not at the pleaſure of the debters, but of him to whome the debt belonges. This image, or as I ſaid before, this print is ſetled in the buſineſſes of men, from the verie heigth of equitie. Men therefore, ſince, by the teſtimonie of the Apoſtle, all doe die in Adam, from whome the very root of oftending God, ſprong forth amongſt all mankinde, are euen a lump of ſinne owing penance to Gods great iuſtice, which whether God inflict vppon them, or pardon them, he ſhall by doing neither of the two ſhew himſelfe vniuſt. But it is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great inſolency in the debters to make them ſelues iudges to whome this puniſhment is to be forgiuen, and vpon whome to be inflicted, like as their indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was moſt ſenſeles who being hired in the vineyard, repined whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw others as largely rewarded as themſelues. The Apoſtle doth thus therefore beat back all
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:19839:124"/>impudencie that may ariſe out of this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. O man, who art thou, that doeſt thus gaineſay God? For what doth he elſe, when that diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him which god complaines of concerning ſinners? As if God do preſently conſtraine a man to ſinne, if he doe but only withhold the mercie of his iuſtification from him whilſt he ſinneth, and for this cauſe muſt be ſaid to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſome offenders, not becauſe he inforceth them thereto, but becauſe he taketh not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on them? Now thoſe they are of whom he taketh no compaſſion, vpon whome he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in that ſecret iuſtice of his, to which mans weake ſenſe is in no caſe able to attaine, that there is no compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be taken: for his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not to be ſearched, nor his pathes to be paſſed. But he iuſtly complaines of ſinners, as of thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would by no meanes haue offend; and with all that thoſe of whome hee bath compaſſion, ſeeing their god ſo grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to complaine of ſinners, might attaine vnto this vocation, and being gauled euen at their verie heart, returne into his fauour. Moſt iuſtly therefore and mercifully doth he complaine. But if this moue vs, for that no man reſiſteth his pleaſure, becauſe whome he ſo pleaſeth he helpeth, and whome he will againe he forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; when both he whome he helpeth, and he alſo whome he forſaketh, come both of the ſelfe ſame lump of ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp; howſoeuer both of them be ſubiect to puniſhment, yet one of them hath it pardoned vnto him, &amp; the other
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:19839:124"/>performed vpon him: If then this do moue vs, O man, who art thou, that thou gainſaiſt God: For I gueſſe it to bee all one with that where it is ſaid, are you not men, and doe you not walke after the manner of men? for vnder this name are ment both the carnall, and the ſpirituall, to whome it is ſaid I could not ſpeake to you as to ſpirituall men, but as to carnall. And againe, for you could not as yet, neither hitherto can you: for ye are yet carnall. And againe, but a carnall man doth not vnderſtand the thinges which belong to the ſpirit of God: To theſe therefore it is ſaide, O man, who art thou, that thou gaineſaieſt God? Doth that which is fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſay vnto him which hath framed it, why haſt thou thus faſhioned me? Or hath not hee which worketh in clay, power, to make out of the ſame heap, a veſſell for honor, and a veſſell for reproch? Euen therehence it may happely ſufficiently appeare that hee ſpake to a carnall man, becauſe the verie clay of which man was firſt framed, ſignifies as much. And becauſe al, as I ſhewed ere whilſt out of the ſame Apoſtle, are dead in Adam, he ſaith we are all of one &amp; the ſame ſtuffe. And although one veſſel bee made for honor, and another for diſgrace, yet it muſt needs be that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which was made for honor, haue a carnall infancie, and ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ariſe vp to a riper kinde of ſpirituall age; ſince they were now made for honor, &amp; borne in Chriſt, but being he ſpeaketh to thoſe which are yet infants, he calleth them carnall, ſaying,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:19839:125"/>I could not ſpeake to you as to ſpirituall, but as to carnall. I gaue you being as yet little ones in Chriſt, milke to drinke not ſtronger meate, for neither were you able, neither yet are you: for euen yet ye are carnall. For all therefore he tearme them carnall, yet he addeth further that they are borne in Chriſt, and little ones in him, and ſucklings; and in that he ioyneth to all this, neither yet can you: he inſinuateth thus much, that when they haue profited ſomething more hereafter, they will be able, becauſe that now grace is begunne in them, being ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally borne a new. Therefore they were now veſſels made for honor, and yet ſo as that it might well be ſaid vnto them, O man, what art thou, that thou ſhouldſt gaineſay God? And if it be rightly ſpoken to ſuch, much more rightly may it be ſpoken to ſuch as are not yet ſo rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, but are made for diſgrace. Let vs ſtill hold this with a ſtedfaſt faith, that there is not iniuſtice with God: and whether he be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to pardon man his debt, or to exact it at his hands, neither can he rightly finde fault with his iniuſtice of whome he exacteth this debt, nor be in any caſe boaſt himſelfe of his owne deſerts to whome he forgiueth it. For both that is debt which the one payeth, and the other receiueth whatſoeuer he hath. But here wee muſt labour, with the help of God, to ſee how that may bee true, which is written, thou haſt hated nothing which thou createdſt. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that, I haue loued Iacob, but Eſau haue I
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:19839:125"/>hated. For if he therefore hated Eſau, becauſe he was a veſſell made for diſgrace, and the ſame potter maketh one veſſel for honor another for diſgrace, how haſt thou hated nothing of that which thou createdſt? For ſee, he hath hated E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, which himſelf created a veſſell for diſgrace: which doubt may be thus manifeſted, that we know God to bee the maker of all creatures; now euerie creature of God is good: and euery man ſo farre as he is man, is a creature of god<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not as he is a ſinner. Therefore God is the maker both of the bodie, and of the minde of man, and neither of theſe is euill, neither doth God hate either of them, for he hateth nothing which himſelfe hath created. But the minde is more excellent then the body, and God, then either the bodie or the minde, being the maker and creator of them both, neither doth he hate any thing in man but ſinne. Now the ſinne of man is a certaine diſorder &amp; crookednes; that is to ſay, a turning backward from his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t maker, and a bending to his baſer creatures. Therefore God hateth not Eſau as he is a man, but as he is a ſinner: as it is ſaid of the Lord, He came amongſt his owne, and his would not entertaine him: to whom alſo he ſaith himſelfe, yet therefore haue not heard, becauſe ye are not of God. How were they his? and how were they not of god? vnles becauſe the one be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of men, whom the Lord himſelfe made, and the other of ſinners whom the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did condemne. And yet the ſame are
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:19839:126"/>both men and ſinners: men, by their eſtate, but ſinners by their owne proper will. Why then did he loue Iacob? was he not a ſinner? But he loued in him not the fault, which he cleane extinguiſhed, but the grace which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him. For Chriſt died for the wicked, yet not that the wicked ſhould remaine dead, but that being iuſtified they might be conuerted from their wickednes, beleeuing in him which iuſtifieth the wicked. For God hateth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, therefore in ſome be puniſheth it by condemnation, in others he taketh it away by iuſtification, as he thinketh beſt in thoſe his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable iudgements. And becauſe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them veſſels of diſgrace amongſt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whome he doth not iuſtifie, he hateth not this in them which he maketh; for inaſmuch as they are wicked, they are accurſed, but in as much as they are made veſſels, they are ſo made for ſome vſe. That through the puniſhment ordained for them, thoſe veſſells which were made for honour might reape ſome profit. Therefore God hateth them, neither as they are men, nor as they are veſſells; that is to ſay, he hateth not that in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which by ordinance he made: for he hateth nothing that he hath made. But yet in that he maketh them the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of perdition, he maketh them to the ende to correct others. For he hateth in them the wickednes, which himſelfe made not. For as the iudge hateth the theft in the man, but not the weapon which he vſed in the attaining of his bootie, the one beeing the treſpaſſe of a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:19839:126"/>thiefe, the other no more then the iudge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth and may vſe: So God when out of the heape of wicked men he maketh veſſels of perdition, hateth not that which he maketh, that is, the worke which he ordained, in the puniſhment due to thoſe which periſh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they of whome he taketh compaſſion may finde meanes of their owne ſaluation. So was it ſaide to Pharao: I ſtirred thee vp thereto, that I might ſhew my power in thee, that my name might be made knowne through the whole earth. This manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the power of God, and illuſtration of his name through the whole earth, is good to draw them to feare, and correct their waies, with whom ſuch a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling agreeth. So conſequently he ſaies, that if God beeing deſirous to ſhew his anger, and make knowne his power, did in great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of patience bring the veſſells of anger, which were made for deſtruction (there muſt be vnderſtood who art thou, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt gaineſay God? that the ſentence taking recourſe to the former words, this may be the meaning.) If God beeing deſirous to ſhew his anger, and make knowne his power, brought the veſſells of wrath, who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt gainſay God? yet not only being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſhew his wrath and make known his power, brought in abundance of patience, the veſſels of wrath which were made for deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but that which followes too; That he might manifeſt the riches of his glorie vpon the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:19839:127"/>veſſels of mercie. For what profiteth it the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels made for deſtruction, that God ſuſtaineth them patiently, that he may deſtroy the ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and vſeth them as an inſtrument of other mens ſaluation, whome he taketh compaſſion on? But it likewiſe profiteth them for whoſe ſafetie he vſeth theſe: That, as it is written, the righteous may waſh his hands in the blood of the ſinner, that is to ſay, that he may be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his euill workes through the feare of God, when he ſeeth the puniſhment of ſinners. It therfore auaileth to cauſe a profitable feare in other men, and to make knowne the riches of Gods glorie toward the veſſells of mercie which he hath prepared to glorie, that God willing to ſhew his anger, brought the veſſels of wrath. For that hardning of wicked men maketh both theſe plaine: As wel what is to be feared that euery man may be conuerted to God in pietie, as alſo how great the graces of Gods mercie are, who ſheweth how much he pardoneth ſome, by puniſhing others. But if that be no iuſt puniſhment which he inflicteth vpon ſome, he pardoneth nothing vnto others, vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth not inflict this puniſhment. But becauſe that is moſt iuſt, and there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice with God, who is able worthily to thanke him that remitteth this, which if he would inflict vpon vs, no man could rightly ſay that he ought not. Whom alſo he called. Vs, quoth he, not only of the Iewes but alſo of the Gentiles, that is, the veſſells of mercie which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:19839:127"/>he prepared to glorie. For he called not all the Iewes, but ſome of them: nor all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, but likewiſe ſome of them. For there is one lumpe of ſinnefull and wicked men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Adam, wherein both Iewes and Gentiles, the fauour of God beeing ſet apart, haue equall ſhare. For if the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as out of the ſame heape he maketh one veſſell for honour, an other for diſgrace; now it is manifeſt that ſome of the Iewes are made veſſels for honour, and ſome for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, as likewiſe it is with the Gentiles. It followes that all be vnderſtoode to belong to the ſame heape; Then he beginneth to rehearſe diuers proteſtations of the Prophet in euery particular kinde, the order beeing chaunged. For firſt he ſpake of thoſe of the Iewes which were conuerted, and afterwards of thoſe of the Gentiles. Now he firſt alleadgeth teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie for the Gentiles, and then for the Iewes. For as he ſaith in Oſee, I will call thoſe which are not my people, my people, and thoſe which are not my beloued, my beloued: and where it is ſaid you are not my people, there ſhall it be ſaid, you are the ſonnes of the liuing God. This ſaying is meant of the Gentiles, becauſe they had not one appointed place of ſacrifice, as the Iewes had in Ieruſalem. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were ſent to the Gentiles, that euery one might beleeue, in the place where he was, and might there offer ſacrifice of thankſgiuing, whereſoeuer they beleeued, to whom he gaue
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19839:128"/>power to be made the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. But E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſai ſaith, he crieth out for Iſrael. That all Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el may not be thought to haue gone again into deſtruction. And then he ſheweth, that there were other beſides made for honour, other for diſgrace: If, quoth he, the number of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſhall be as the ſands of the ſea, the remnant ſhall be ſafe; the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie then, were veſſels made for deſtruction. For, ſaith he, the Lord ſhall accuſe vpon the earth. That is to ſay, that by the benefit of faith, he may ſaue thoſe which beleeue through grace, not through the infinite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations wherewith that multitude beeing moſt baſely loaden was oppreſſed. For tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough grace he finiſhed his word for vs vpon the earth, ſaying my yoke is light, and my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pleaſant: which is here mentioned a little after. The word is almoſt in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is, the word of faith which we preach, becauſe if thou confeſſe in thy mouth, becauſe Ieſus is the true Lord, and beleeue in thy heart, becauſe God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſafe. For we beleeue in our heart for righteouſnes ſake, but confeſſe with our mouthes for ſaluation. This is that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed word which God made vpon the earth, by which accompliſhment, the theefe was iuſtified, who hauing all his other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers faſtened vpon the croſſe, and theſe two onely free, beleeued in his heart for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and confeſſed with his mouth for ſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſake, thereupon deſeruing to heare this,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:19839:128"/>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. For now his good works ſhould follow, if by the receit of grace, he were to liue longer amongſt men. But yet thoſe good works went not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might deſerue the ſame fauour, beeing after his offence faſtened to the croſſe, to be tranſported to Paradiſe. And as Eſaias foretold, ſaith he, vnleſſe the Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both had left vs ſeede, this is in the ſame place, the remnant ſhould be ſafe. But the other as veſſells of deſtruction haue periſhed as they ought. And it was not their deſert, that all of them periſhed not, as at the downefall of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorra, but the grace of God left a ſeede, from whence newe increaſe might ſpring throughout the whole world. And this a little after, So therefore, ſaith he, in this time alſo the reſidue was ſaued by election of grace. And if by grace then not by workes: otherwiſe grace is no grace. VVhat then? Iſrael obteined not that which it ſought, but the choſen obtained it, the other beeing blinded. The veſſels of mercie obtained it, but the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of anger were blinded, yet proceeding both out of the ſame heape, as in the fulneſſe of the nations. There is a place in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very fitte for the point which we haue in hand, ratifying the ſame with a woonderfull conteſtation, in the book, which ſome tearme, Ieſus of Syracke, ſome Eccleſiaſticus, where it is thus written. And all men are of the ſame mould or earth, from whence Adam was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19839:129"/>In the multitude of diſcipline, God ſepa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rated them and altered their waies. And ſome of them he bleſſed &amp; exalted, ſanctifying them and applying them to himſelfe, and ſome he curſed and brought low, and turned them to their diſagreement, as the clay of the potter in his hand, to lay it and order it. All his waies are according to his owne diſpoſition, ſo man is in the hand of him which made him, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore vnto him according to his iudgement. Good is contrarie to euill, &amp; life to death: ſo is the iuſt alſo to the wicked. And ſo looke into al the works of the moſt high. Two againſt two, &amp; one againſt one. Here firſt the diſcipline of God is commended. In the multitude of diſcipline, ſaith he, he ſeparated them; From whence but onely from the bleſſednes of Paradiſe? And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their waies, that they might now liue as mortal men. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there made one lump of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of the bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of ſinne, &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mortalitie, howſoeuer God made and created in all things good. For the ſhape &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our bodies, is in euery member ſo well ordered, that the Apoſtle to winne men to charitie, did there hence draw a certaine likenes to be in all men. Our breath is alſo full of life, and cheriſheth our earthly limmes, and all the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the gouernment of the ſoule, and ſeruice of the bodie, and wonderfully tempered condition thereof, but ſo that the luſt of the fleſh doth now raigne by reaſon of the puniſhment of ſinne, had confounded all mankinde, as one and the ſame heape, the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:19839:129"/>guiltineſſe from the beginning remaining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all; and yet it follows, ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and exalted, and ſanctified them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them to himſelfe, and ſome of them hee curſed and brought low, &amp; ſet them at diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, Is it not in the potters power to make out of the ſame heap one veſſell for honor, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for diſgrace? And therefore that which is added, and it is not vnlike that. As the potters clay, ſaith he, is in his hand to lay and order it: all his wayes are according to his owne diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſo is man in the hand of him which made him. But becauſe the Apoſtle ſayes, Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniuſtice with God? ſee alſo what he ioynes hereto, he ſhall pay him ſaieth he according to his iudgement. But ſince iuſt puniſhments are inflicted vppon the damned, yet becauſe it is turned to that vſe, that they may reap profite thereby who are taken pittie on; marke what followes. God is contrarie to euil, ſaith he, and life to death; ſo alſo the iuſt to the wicked: and ſo looke into all the works of the moſt high, there are two againſt two, and one againſt one. That out of the compariſon of the good, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may ariſe, which are better as it were by grace. As if he ſhould ſay, the reſidue ſhalbe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: he goes on and ſpeaks in the perſon of the reſidue. And I haue very lately watched, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like one which gathereth grapes after the maiſter of the vineyard hath done. And how will he make this good, becauſe not for their owne deſerts, therefore by the mercie of god?
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:19839:130"/>In the bleſſing of God, ſaith he, and I hoped: &amp; like the labourer in the vineyard I filled my preſſe. For although he watched very lately, yet becauſe, as it is ſaid, the lateſt were firſt, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in the bleſſing of the Lord, glauncing out of the reliques of Iſrael, filled his preſſe out of the fertilitie of the vineyard, which proceeded from the whole world. Then I can ſee no other meaning of the Apoſtles, and all the iuſtified, through whome the knowledge of grace was ſhewed vnto vs, but that hee which boaſteth ſhould boaſt in the Lord. For who can ſearch into the works of God, that out of the ſame heape, condemneth one, and iuſtifieth another? The free choice of will, is of great force; verie true: but it little auaileth them which are ſold vnder ſinne. The fleſh ſaith he, luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, that ye cannot do what you would, we are warned to liue wel: this reward being propounded to vs, that we may get to liue bleſſedly for euer. But who can liue well, and do that which is good, vnleſſe he be iuſtified by faith? we are warned to beleeue, that through loue receiuing the gift of the holy ghoſt we may do well. But who can beleeue vnleſſe he be touched with ſome voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, with ſome teſtification of things? In whoſe power is it to haue his minde tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſuch a viſion, as that his will may thereby beſtirred vp to faith? And who embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that in his minde which delighteth him not? Or who hath that power to meet with that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:19839:130"/>vvhich may delight him, or if he do meet vvith it, to delight himſelfe therein? Since therefore thoſe thinges delight vs by which wee may come to God, this commeth by the grace of God; not at our beck, nor is it gotten by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie or vvorks: becauſe it is his gift that vve haue a will, induſtrie, and works of charitie. Therefore we are bidden to aske that we may receiue, to ſeeke that we may finde, to knock that it may be opened vnto vs. Is not one verie prayer ſometime ſo luke warme, or rather ſo colde, and almoſt none, nay none at all, that we doe not ſo much as marke this in our ſelues with griefe, becauſe when we grieue at it we do euen then pray alſo: What is therefore elſe ſhewed vnto vs, but that he commaunds vs to aske, ſeek, and knock, who bids vs flie all theſe things: therefore it is not in the power either of him which willeth or of him which runneth, but of God who taketh compaſſion on, ſince vnleſſe he ſtirre vs vp thereto, we can neither will nor runne. But if here were any election, that we ſhould thus vnderſtand that which was ſpoken, The reſidue were ſaued, by the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, not that the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe which are iuſtified ſhould be to life euerlaſting, but that they might be knowne which are iuſtified, ſurely this is ſo ſecret an election, that it can by no meanes appeare vnto vs out of the ſame heap: or if it do appeare to ſome, I am content herein to acknowledge mine owne weakenes. For haue not wherewith to looke into the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19839:131"/>chooſing of men to ſauing grace, if I be drawne by any cogitation to thinke vppon the top of this election, vnleſſe I had either more witt or lighter ſinnes, or both, or, if you will haue a fourth, vnleſſe I had honeſt and profitable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: whatſoeuer hee bee therefore that is tainted but with the leaſt ſinnes, for well I know that there is none free from all ſinne, if he be of a quick witt, and haue the liberall ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences at his fingers ends, my thinks he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be choſen to this grace. But whilſt I profeſſe thus, he which choſeth the weak of the world that he may confound the ſtrong, and the fooliſh that he may confound the wiſe, will come vpon me ſo, that I being now with ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him become ſomewhat ſhamefaſt, may thus ſcoffe at many, which both in regard of ſome ſinners are ſomething pure, and in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of fiſhers accounted orators. Haue we not ſeene many of theſe our faithful ones walking in the way of God, to bee for witt compared, not onely to no heretike, but not ſo much as to any baſe morriſe dauncer? Againe do we not ſee diuers of both ſexes liue in all matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all chaſtitie without complaint, and yet either hereticks or pagans, or at leaſt ſcarce warme in the true church and beliefe, in ſo much that we wonder ſeing them ſurpaſſed not onely in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and temperancy: but alſo in faith, hope, and charitie, euen of verie bagages and ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>players, who are but newly conuerted? It ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remaines that our wills be choſen. But
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19839:131"/>the bare will vnleſſe ſomething meet with it that delighteth and inticeth the minde, cannot by any meanes be moued. Now it is not in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s power that any ſuch thing ſhould meet with it. What was Sauls will, but to ruſh amongſt, draw, binde, and kill the chriſtians? what a raging, furious, and blinde will was his, who notwithſtanding was made to dapp to the very ground by one voyce ſent from aboue, and a viſion appearing with it; which minde of his, &amp; headſtrong wilbe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to all crueltie, being wrung and wrethed to beleife; he was in a triſe made of a maruelous perſecutor of the goſpel, a more maruelous preacher of the ſame. And yet what ſhall we ſay? is there any iniuſtice with God? which puniſheth &amp; pardoneth whom it pleaſe him, puniſhing them onely that deſerue it, and pardoning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>y one, not for any thing that the pardoned can alleadge for himſelfe? Is ther now any iniuſtice with God? God forbidd: but wherefore then doth he deale thus with one, and contrariely with another? O man, who art thou? if thou ſuffer not that which thou deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, giue God thanks: thou art happie: mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie if thou do ſuffer it, thou haſt no cauſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: let vs only beleeue, if we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not take hold of: becauſe he which made euery creature, both ſpirituall and corporall, diſpoſeth al things in iuſt number, weight, &amp; meaſure: but his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are vnſearchable, &amp; his pathes not to be trodden. Let vs ſay Alleluia, and ſing a ſong of praiſe, without queſtioning, either what is this,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:19839:132"/>or for what ende was that? For all things were created in their due time. Hitherto were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines words pertaining to the ſetting clear of the ſecond queſtion. And leaſt any ſhould thinke that Auſtin handled this doctrine which he ſent to Simplician co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Sanct.</hi> chap. 4. pag. 843. Ye ſee now what I thought then of faith and workes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were my care to commend vnto you the grace of God, in which opinion I ſee that theſe brethren are now alſo, becauſe they had not the like care to profit with me in theſe bookes, that they had to read them with me. For if they had taken any care, they might haue found this queſtion diſcuſſed, according to the truth of the holy Scriptures, in the firſt of thoſe two bookes which I wrote to Simplician bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ouer the Church of the Mediolanenſes, that man of bleſſed memorie, in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his biſhopricke, then ſucceeding S. Ambroſe, vnleſſe peraduenture they came not to the knowledge of thoſe bookes; which if it be ſo, be a meanes. I pray you, that they may know them. Againe out of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, tom. 7. <hi>lib. de praedeſt. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 16. pag. 832. But I come to the little ones, I come to the twinnes; that is not enough; I come to thoſe which are yet vnborne; which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten at one and the ſame copulation, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:19839:132"/>were to be brought forth at the ſame inſtant. The differing &amp; diuers iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Gods will appearing to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, The greatnes of this queſtion troubleth the ſenſes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſputing ſo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the will of God. Now ſtretch thy winde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and baule thou as loude as thy throat wil giue thee leaue, thou vniuſt accuſer of the iuſt. What ill had he committed, tell me? or what good had the other deſerued? and he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thee, not I, but Paul the Apoſtle, truely nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them had deſerued any thing: but it is in the potters power, to make out of the ſame lump one veſſell to honor, and another to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: you will aske why? what confuſed diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie is there in this iudgement? Let him againe confute this preſumption, and ſay, O man what art thou that thou thus gainſaieſt God? eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe the intent being againe chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, aunſwereth to that compariſon of mans actions, that the creditor cannot be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of iniuſtice, who meanes thus to diſpoſe of two of his debters, that he will aske of one, &amp; remit to the other, that which he may, if he pleaſe, exſpect alike from them both. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is moſt true, that in all the ſleights &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of mans conuerſation, which are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the deſciding of any matter or to the iudging of this iuſtice whereby we ſeeme to trie any other, it floweth into our hearts, out of the vnſpeakable fullnes of Gods iuſtice, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Iohn affirming that ſame in his goſpell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue all receiued of the fulnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:19839:133"/>of: which being ſo, with what impudencie ſhal man being as clay in compariſon of the pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, iudge of God? Not onely ſaying why haſt thou faſhioned me ſo? but alſo with a damnable kinde of curioſitie, queſtioning of others, and asking, why haſt thou out of the ſame lumpe made one thus, and another ſo? If man, which at the firſt was made of nothing, were not borne ſubiect to death and ſinne, and yet it would pleaſe God to ſend ſome of them into vtter deſtruction, who would ſay to the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent creator, why haſt thou faſhioned me ſo? For wee cannot denie him to appoint them to what end pleaſeth him, who when they were not, gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their being. Neither ſhould ſome others ſay, why doth Gods iudgement differ, ſince all deſerts are alike, becauſe it is in the power of the potter, to make out of the ſame lump one veſſell for honour, another for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. But now ſince the damned be iuſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, &amp; thoſe which are ſaued, cannot claime their ſaluation vpon due, who being forgetfull of mans eſtate, may ſo farre looke into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of God, as that himſelfe being deſeruedly puniſhed, he dare aske why another receiued that fauour which was not due vnto him? Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes therefore when he them taught that fleſhly people, ſhewed that this diuine election, was not due to deſerts, but that it was giuen to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſole bountie of God. For thus he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the people moſt manifeſtly in Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomie, Behold the heauen is the Lord thy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:19839:133"/>Gods, and the heauen which is aboue the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, the earth and all that therein is. But the Lord choſe your forefathers to loue them, and their ſeede, and after them he choſe you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other nations. And he added, Be ye circumciſed therfore from the hardnes of your hearts, and ſtiffen not your neckes any more. But bleſſed Steuen, when he called vpon the Iewes, ſhewed that this hardnes of heart was in them, as I ſaide before. For he ſaith in the Acts of the Apoſtles on this wiſe. You haue alwaies reſiſted the holy ghoſt, with ſtiffe necks and vncircumciſed hearts and eares. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence aroſe the ſtiffeneckednes in the people which was choſen from the whole world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, who by tenne miracles got to be freed from bondage, to whome the law was giuen, for whoſe ſafetie the mouthes of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did contend, for whome Chriſt became fleſh, and to whome he was ſent, but becauſe there was blindnes ouer a great part of Iſrael, till it beeing adopted, out of the fulnes of the nations, entred into the kingdome, and the Lord ſhut vp all of them in incredulitie, that all of them might ſtand in neede of the mercie of the Sauiour. The ſacraments of which diuine cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile, &amp; myſterie of Gods maieſtie, euen he which for perſecutions &amp; blaſphemies deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not to be tearmed a veſſel of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching (for howſoeuer by the multitude of reuelations he knew them, yet he was faine to yeeld in regard of his humane weaknes) in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:19839:134"/>crieth out, O the depth of Gods moſt rich wiſdome and knowledge! confeſſing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, that his paths and counſels were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable. Therefore whenſoeuer there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth any queſtion amongſt vs concerning ſuch things, let vs wonder, and holding this ſtill for certaine, that there is no iniuſtice with God, if that whereof there is doubt, be a thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding our vnderſtanding, and our capacitie cannot reach into the depth of it, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it to remaine in that fulnes of the iuſtice, mercie, and foreknowledge of God, without any breach of his iuſtice. Leaſt diſputing of the high ſecrets of Gods will, otherwiſe then the pitch of our eſtate will permit vs, we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the iuſtice of God, and coueting to build vp our own, fall downe headlong into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe gulfe of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
